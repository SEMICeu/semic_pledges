# Setting up the environment

<div style='text-align: justify;'>

## Installing Python

The Python programming language can be installed on any computer and operating system by visiting Python's website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and downloading **the latest version** of the language.

</p>

After this download, an executable file (*python-downloaded version-amd64.exe* for Windows) should appear in the Downloads folder of the computer. To finalize the installation of Python, the *.exe* file needs to be executed, i.e., one should double click on the file and follow the instructions prompted by the window:

## Installing a code editor

For the purpose of this project, we chose to rely on Microsoft Visual Studio Code, a code editor that allows to write, edit, and run code on a local device. Therefore, in the following pages we will present procedure to install, clone a repository, create a virtual environment, etc. within the specific set up of VS code. Nevertheless, other IDEs such as PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook can also be used to run this project, but their specificities will not be covered here. 

Similarly to the installation of Python, VS code can be installed on a local device by exucting a *.exe* file downloaded on the following website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

## Cloning the semic_pledges repository

To reproduce the results from this pledges' analysis locally, the Github repository we used (https://github.com/SEMICeu/semic_pledges) needs to be cloned to one's local device. To reach this objective, the following steps should be followed: 

### 1) Github account

Create a Github account and request access to the semic_pledges repository

### 2) Installing Git

To work with Github repositories, VS code requires the installation of a source control software named *git*. The software can be installed by visiting https://git-scm.com/downloads, downloading the latest version, and running the related *.exe* file.

</p>

### 3) Creating a new folder

Create a new folder on one's local device. This folder will be used to clone the GitHub repository

</p>

### Cloning in VS code

For this last step, the objective is to clone the repository in the code editor. 

a. In VS code, click on the **Source control** icon

b. In the **Source control** window, click on **Clone Repository**

c. VS code will prompt for **Repository URL**. Enter the following URL: https://github.com/SEMICeu/semic_pledges.git

</p>

d. Sign into GitHub (or git) using one's GitHub credentials (if asked)

e. Select the recently created folder as destination for the repository

f. Trust the authors of the codes

</p>

g. The project should appear in the editor
