1,1,"EFFAT welcomes the Commission Proposal for a Regulation on data collection and sharing relating to short-term accommodation rental services COM(2022) 571 published on 7 November 2022. Such regulation is a first important step to ensure fair competition and a level playing field between all providers of accommodation services.

The collection of full and comprehensive data on short-term rental hosts and guests, and the obligation of short-term rental platforms to provide these data to national competent authorities, as well as the sharing of the data at European level, will enable Member States to better regulate the sector in a harmonised approach.

EFFAT, together with its social partner HOTREC, has been advocating for many years for a level playing field and fair competition in hospitality and tourism, asking that the same rules have to be applied to all providers of accommodation services, with regard to  e.g.
- Legislation
- Fiscal obligations
- Food hygiene rules
- Registration and permits for operation
- Licensing to serve alcohol
- Statistical measurement of the economic activity
- Safety and security
- Employees’ rights and protection
- Consumers’ rights
- Right to proper living conditions of residential neighbourhoods
- Zoning in urban planning, e.g. the distinction between residential and commercial properties
(see Joint EFFAT-HOTREC Statements on the Sharing / Platform Economy of December 2015 and November 2019)

EFFAT will 
- in 2023-2024, follow the legislative procedure for the Regulation through European Parliament and Council of Ministers
- during this legislative procedure, regularly keep its national member organisations updated about the legislation in the making, by reporting at least 2 times per year on the progress made and agree on measures to be taken by EFFAT and national affiliates
- once the Regulation is finally adopted, ask national member organisations to monitor the transposition of the Regulation in their countries and to push for its proper implementation, and to report at least 2 times per year about the actions taken and the progress made 
- follow the work of the Single Digital Entry Points Coordination Group composed of Member States' national coordinators
- continue to address the issue of short-term accommodation rental services in the Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee Horeca, by putting it on the agenda of the 2 Working Group and 1 Plenary meetings per year, and to undertake joint actions with its social partner HOTREC whenever necessary
- continue to advocate for further measures to guarantee a level playing field and fair competition in hospitality and tourism, by compelling short-term accommodation rental services to comply with the same rules and obligations as other accommodation providers

The actions described above shall contribute to achieving the aim that all short-term accommodation rental platforms have applied the obligations of the Regulation by 2025, or at least 2 years after its coming into force.",Ready for publishing

The study report on health tourism (European Parliament, 2017) and the report on health tourism (UNWTO & ETC, 2018) imply that increasing the share of health tourism may reduce tourism seasonality, improve sustainability, and labour quality, and help to reduce healthcare costs through prevention measures and decreased pharmaceutical consumption. However, both reports lack primary data, and they did not consider the needs of the private sector.
Investing into developing high-quality data bases and benchmarking across all segments of the health tourism sector in Europe. Big data are the key to measure success in the digital era, but it requires intense efforts from the public and private sector.

After 10 months of participatory consultations during which all the territory’s stakeholders exchanged their ideas for the tourism and events of tomorrow, Bordeaux Metropole has developed its roadmap up to 2026.

This document is the result of a synthesis of the ideas exchanged during the 9 workshops. Bordeaux Tourist & Conventions Office and Bordeaux Métropole worked hand in hand to offer a panel of 32 detailed actions with precise objectives, success indicators, a timetable and identification of key partners. A maximum of parameters were taken into account and calculated to ensure the proper implementation of each action.

Here are the objectives that the destination is committed to meeting:
– Improving the offer and accompanying it through its environmental transition so that it is adapted to the new customers’ expectations and to the environmental commitments of Bordeaux Métropole, to go back to pre-Covid tourism performances by renewing and creating customer loyalty thanks to the upgrade and transformation of the offering.

– Developing local tourism to guarantee a balance for the territory, extending touristic seasons, incentivising dialogue between residents and visitors by offering to the metropolis’ inhabitants new discoveries and stay in and around Bordeaux Métropole area.

– Developing business tourism alongside with the territory’s sectors of excellence to always use better our dedicated infrastructures – those which have been built recently or those for which investments have been planned – and to increase economic impacts for the area regarding main sectors and skills

Working with a wide range of tourism organisations in different member states, our methodology and approach are always evolving. 

What’s the goal? To identify trends ahead of the curve, incorporate priorities driven by values and develop methods which bring expertise, intelligence, insight and co-design together - shaping informed decisions and outcomes. 

Our work is underpinned by openness and transparency, which is why we are committed to openly publishing our methodology and approach. As we undergo the next iteration of our strategic methodology, we are committed to incorporating the principles underlined in the transition pathway, in particular, the twin transition represent key pillars.

We believe these are profoundly important to consider and apply as underlying principles in a broad spectrum of strategic needs, from initiating innovation systems to setting multi-year transformation strategies in tourism.

Specifically, this will take form as follows:

1. Incorporating the Transition Pathway for Tourism, as well as the Sustainable, Digital Transition Methodology as a dual set of principles into strategic development work, including destination strategies and trend analysis.

2. Creation of a new design-led workshop series ""Smart. Sustainable. Destination Design."" based on the principles of the Transition Pathway to help stakeholders undertake a comprehensive evaluation of their strategic objectives.

Prerequisites

The keys to success are in ensuring all members of the Digital Tourism Think Tank’s Knowledge Team are fully trained on and aware of the Transition Pathway. In particular, it requires a detailed understanding of the twin transition and its implications for tourism at a strategic and practical level.

Further measures required:

- Update strategic methodology to incorporate ‘Sustainable, Digital Transition’. [DTTT Internal]
- In-depth training of the knowledge team on incorporating Sustainable, Digital Transition into the strategic process. [DTTT Internal]
- Awareness-raising actions amongst the EU tourism community, including institutional-level support [Public Sector Stakeholders]
- Demand generation amongst potential clients for strategies, workshops and actions applying methodology [Public Sector Stakeholders]

Key Milestones

- June 2023 - Incorporate Sustainable, Digital Transition into DTTT Methodology
- September 2023 - Launch and promote methodology, raising awareness of the need, opportunity and potential gain
- January 2024 - Establish successful projects either underway or with completed outcomes, including clear goals and objectives aligned with the priorities set out in the twin transition.

Current situation: The Development Strategy of the City of Zagreb, as the City's main strategic development document, which includes tourism to a minor extent, became insufficient for further growth and development of sustainable tourism in the City of Zagreb. Also, there is no clearly defined direction of further development of tourism, based on sustainability principles. Since tourism, in its scope, closely interacts and depends on other sectors, such as transport, agriculture, health, digitalisation, landscaping and others, it is necessary to prepare a strategy aligned with sustainable policies for the other sectors and representing a starting point for embracing and further development of the issues and measures touching upon tourism sector in the preparation of their plans.  
So far, the development of tourism was mainly based on the exploitation of the existing tourist basis, without strategic investments in the area of tourism. For that reason, the Strategy will also analyse those city resources that can represent an axis of further development of sustainable tourism, such as city assets, city infrastructure, transport, architecture, cultural heritage, local population etc., together with the plan aimed at resolving the problems defined in the programme.  By defining specific advantages and resolving specific challenges of the destination, tourist potential of the available area will be considered, as well as its basis, in terms of resources and attractions.

From this point of view building and development of the organizational structure of NTO is essential. The next step will be creation of thematic tourism product management. As a target for 2025, NTO plans to prepare 4-8 thematic product lines for marketing and sales activities. In the process of creating the product lines we make efforts to include the principles of sustainability – as using regional products and sources, supporting local communities, creating authentic offers and deliverying exceptional tourism experience.
It will be supported by effective networking of DMO´s, professional organisations and tourism stakeholders. 

In order to ensure collaborative governance of tourism destinations, we support cooperation of professional tourism organizations at all levels (NTO, 8 regional tourism organizations and 39 district tourism organizations - DMOs). In the field of the cooperation of DMOs, we encourage them to become a member of the professional association of DMOs which can provide them opportunities for collective action and communication toward government entities and other tourism stakeholders on regular basis.

Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit which aims at balancing the uses of cultural heritage and other territorial assets by the residents, the visitors, and the tourism businesses. It proposes five key principles addressing aspects related to governance, sense of belonging, promotion, measurability, and interpersonal relations to be endorsed by tourism as well as the cultural and other related stakeholders. It shows the consensus of key stakeholders committed to demonstrate what tourism and cultural heritage sectors can achieve by working more closely together, for the benefit of European citizens and cultural heritage as well as businesses, visitors, and destinations, in line with the SDGs. This is why NECSTouR Regions keeps identifying examples of turning principles into policy measures and projects. First, through an event in Barcelona in September 2022, aiming at generating exchanges, reflections, and debates on how the wellbeing of the local community and the climate actions needs are driving the transformation of the tourism model and ecosystem, moving from sustainable to responsible and regenerative tourism. The event will reflect the legacy of the Barcelona declaration “Better places to Live, Better Places to Visit” in NECSTouR members’ strategies, actions, and initiatives.

88,5,"A collaborative Visitor Management Plan for Scotland:

Post lock-down, many local communities felt unprepared to deal with the large increase in visitors, particularly day visitors, campers and campervans. To address some of the negative impacts on communities, VisitScotland led a successful, large-scale collaboration aimed at engaging stakeholders and visitors on responsible enjoyment. 

Launched in March 2021 with a Responsible Tourism Visitor Pledge, the partnership includes National Park Authorities, Police Scotland, nature, land and transport bodies, as well as local authorities, to provide a robust and practical strategy with short, medium and long-term actions and benefits. 

Leading a collaborative, cross-organisation approach to marketing and communication, a fully realised campaign has now been delivered to provide information, guidance and education around outdoor access, camping, fire & water safety, motorhomes & campervans, littering & waste. Activity encourages greater access to, and enjoyment of, Scotland's outdoors – especially amongst new audiences – so we all #RespectProtectEnjoy. 

VisitScotland and partners will continuously update information on the Plan’s actions and impacts in a publicly available strategy framework and action log: 

https://www.visitscotland.org/about-us/what-we-do/working-in-partnership/visitor-management-plan. 

This includes reporting at the regular virtual summits of the collaborating stakeholders. As visitor management activity is wide ranging and involves many partners, each organisation involved has its own specific targets and KPIs, all aligned to the overarching strategy. 

The Visitor Management Action Plan is regularly monitored to ensure progress is being made and activity is supporting the strategy. Success is measured through reduction in issues relating to littering, fires, water safety, anti-social behaviour and inconsiderate parking.

A strategic framework pulls together the current and planned actions into a cohesive and aligned direction of travel towards a vision of how the visitor experience will develop over a 10-year period. The collective action log records progress against strategic pillars - covering not just VisitScotland as the official tourism organisation, but all partners involved in delivery of the visitor management strategy. 

A future focus for the visitor management work is on three areas: digital solutions (e.g. monitors of visitor volume); camping and motorhome management and infrastructure; and transport solutions.  These will complement the ongoing work on education, promotion of key messages and support for park rangers (which have been critical to the success of the work to date by engaging on-site with visitors and providing advice and guidance).

> What is behavioural science and why is it relevant?
""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) 
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential.
For example, in the sector of mobility we could test solutions that, after the observation of behaviours, use the related congitive biases to orient the choice of sustainable mobility options, for example by making these the default options.",Published

The use of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) is key to decarbonise the industry in the short to medium term.  SAF can deliver significant CO2 emissions savings and is a promising technology to pursue the achievement of the EU Green Deal’s objectives.  For these reasons, Ryanair committed to an industry-leading 12.5% SAF use in 2030.  In April 2022, we announced a partnership with Neste, a SAF supplier, to power approx. one third of our flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend.  This SAF will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%, supporting Ryanair’s Pathway to Net Zero by 2050 decarbonisation goals.  Ryanair has already significantly advanced this commitment by partnering with Trinity College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, which was launched in April 2021.  It is composed by 11 engineers and scientists focused on researching SAF, zero carbon aircraft propulsion systems and noise mapping for low-noise aircraft fleets.

1.Cyclo-tourism and cycling infrastructure
Current situation: In the City of Zagreb there are currently 237,709 m of cycle lanes and sidewalks, while the share of cycle traffic in the overall city traffic is 3%. There are also 54,140 m of roads where shared traffic has been introduced. The existing cycling infrastructure of the City of Zagreb is not adequate (traffic continuity is not adequately managed, kerbs are still undropped, signals are irregularly installed), for which reason there is need for continuous investment, education and promotion of everyday bicycle use. To reach that objective, Zagreb is currently adopting an operation plan for the development of cycling traffic and an activity plan concerning the education and promotion of everyday bicycle use for moving within the city. 
Measure – In the coming period measures and activities will be implemented in order to increase pedestrian and cycling traffic, public transport share, and reduce the share of motor vehicle traffic. Another 3,000 m of cycle lanes will be constructed, especially those separated from pedestrian sidewalks and motor vehicle transport; other forms of shared transport, such as bike sharing and car sharing, will be stimulated as well.
Objective – Long-term objectives include the building of complete cycling infrastructure in the area of the City of Zagreb in order to allow quality and safe movement of cyclists. One of strategic objectives in the future development of urban and suburban traffic on the territory of the City of Zagreb and its wider area significantly relates to sustainable development stimulation through the introduction of cycling traffic in the traffic system. The other objectives, inter alia, include: an 8% increase of the cycling traffic share in the city traffic, growth of cycling surfaces due to the introduction of shared traffic on the pavement and 30 km/h zones in the wider area of the City.
2.Widening of the car-free zones in the very centre of the City
Current situation: The area of the centre of the City of Zagreb extends on a surface of approximately 6.5 km2, while 81,669.92 m of streets are without car traffic. Examples of good practice have shown that the elimination of road traffic and the widening of pedestrian zones increase air quality, reduce traffic jams and noise levels, revive city centres, which, at the end of the day, contributes to the quality of life of all citizens, especially those who live in the City centre. The plan to extend car-free zones would stimulate citizens to a more frequent use of healthier means of transport, such as public transport and bicycles.  
Measures: Gradual extension of car-free zones in the very centre of the city, by transforming the existing streets open to vehicle traffic into car-free streets.
Objective: Reducing road traffic and increasing the number of pedestrian zones (in metres) in the centre of the City of Zagreb by 10% by 2025.
3.Transformation of the City of Zagreb into a smart city
Current situation: Projects and solutions aimed at resolving various citizens’ problems function as isolated points without being interconnected, such that it is not rare that they duplicate or that their full potential is not used; their data are not consolidated or integrated into a single system, which makes it difficult to citizens, and the overall public sector, to navigate in a large amount of information. A recently launched digital infrastructure sector project is the platform Zagreb Smart City Hub, which represents a simple tool for citizens which allows them to find relevant information about “smart” projects in the City area. The platform gives citizens an additional opportunity to communicate about key decisions and get involved in the strategic decision-making, while various information is gathered in a single point. 
Measure: Further development of ZSCH platform in terms of overall integration and interconnection of all databases from the Zagreb City area.
Objective: Full digitalisation of business, a single database and cooperation with citizens, which will ensure enviable quality of life and numerous savings, new business models, economic growth, and finally a high living standard for citizens. Each citizen and business entity will have their digital identity fully integrated with the European service provision system, i.e. with e-Citizens system, such that everyone who stays or lives in Zagreb, either as a business user or a tourist, will effectively be local in digital terms.",Published

For what concerns circularity in the hospitality industry, we will keep exploring opportunities to build projects that allow to test solutions based on behavioural science to enhance a smarter use of resources and a more responsible behaviour of hosts.
By 2025/2030, we expect to have produced and tested behavioural science-based solutions related, among other topics, to circularity in the hospitality industry. These solutions will be brought to the attention of policy makers at different levels, for their scale-up and adoption in public policies. They will also be disseminated to hospitality practitioners who may be interested to replicate them.
> What is behavioural science and why is it relevant?
""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) 
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential. 
For example, in the hospitality industry there can be room to test solutions based on behavioural science to reduce food waste or plastic use, or optimise the use of water and energy.",Published

la sostenibilidad y la circularidad en el turismo) the obligation for every hospitality company to integrate
circularity into its governance system, by defining and setting the minimum content of a Circular Strategy. 
No sector can be circular on its own. Despite this, Tourism is in Balearic Islands the main economic motor (it
accounts itself the production of 25% of its GDP directly, and more than 40% accounting indirect effects),
and therefore absorbs most of the private investment in our archipelago. With this in mind, the policymakers
have designed this obligation in order to boost circular transition, as the hospitality sector has sufficient
traction potential (a long value chain and a huge GDP proportion of Balearic Economy), to make shift its
providers and customers into circularity.
This Circular business strategy consists in 2 parts:
A Circular Evaluation. Before planning our transition to circularity, it's mandatory to understand the gap
between the current state of the business and the optimal circular conditions. To do so, each establishment
must monitor a list of 16 mandatory Key Performance Indicators, grouped under 4 categories or priority areas: Water, Energy, Materials and waste and Alimentation. This circular evaluation has to be updated annually.
Circular Planification: Once the establishment has done its evaluation, it has to commit to several
objectives to improve its indicators, and to do so elaborate five years forward planning, plotting new
investments, processes and formation to achieve them. This planification must be updated, at least, once
every 5 years.
The spirit of this measure is to shape our sector's investment toward circularity, helping the community to
achieve some of the SDG's at the same time the company is improving it's efficiency and reducing its waste
production and resource consumption, boosting also the diversification of Balear Economy..

Green transition of tourism companies :
We commit to operating our business sustainably and building a culture of sustainability. 
We are leading by example by setting carbon reduction targets in line with climate science guidance and by empowering our people to make sustainable choices in their day-to-day work. Using 2019 as a baseline, we have used the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) criteria for a 1.5C future to develop short and medium-term reduction targets.
 Measurable targets:
- 95% reduction in scope 1* & 2** emissions by the end of 2030 from 2019 baseline 
- 50% reduction in scope 3*** emissions by the end of 2030 from 2019 baseline 
- Achieve net-zero by 2040
 
*Scope 1 emissions are natural gas used in offices, fuel for leased company vehicles
**Scope 2 emissions are electricity from offices and data centers
***Scope 3 emissions are purchased goods/services, business travel, employee commuting

Green Transition of tourism SMEs:
We are committed to making it easier for travellers to book more sustainable trips. Supporting tourism accommodations in developing their sustainability programmes, while recognising those who have already made significant efforts to improve the sustainability of their operations. By showcasing these efforts on our platform (increasing the supply of more sustainable travel options), we aim to make it easy for travellers to book more sustainable travel. Today only a small number of  tourism accommodations have invested in existing sustainability certifications.
 
We have launched the  Travel Sustainable Programme that has 2 central components: 
1) Educating and raising awareness amongst tourism accommodations on their impact in the environment they operate in. Initially 32 sustainability practices have been independently validated as impactful. We have been working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Travalyst, Sustainalize and other sustainability experts to share what properties can do to make positive change in the industry. Through the Booking.com Sustainability Handbook, available in 30 languages, Booking.com supports partners to understand which practices may make more sense to them, what impact they will have; sharing tips and best practices. The objective is to get accommodations started on sustainability.
2) A  badge and filter on our product. The badge is awarded automatically to accommodations who already have one of 37 3rd party certifications we accept as part of our framework. For those properties that have implemented sustainability programmes or adopted sustainability practices but cannot afford or commit to the requirements of a 3rd party certification, our programme will award a badge if they reach a sustainability impact threshold, assigned per continent and independently validated as part of our framework.  Travel Sustainable is an evolving programme, designed to make sure that no accommodation however small, is left behind in the sustainability transition. It will continue to evolve to drive forward the sustainability agenda.
We believe the badge will provide credible recognition of impactful sustainability efforts for more properties worldwide and provide travelers with a transparent, consistent and easy-to-understand way to identify a wider range of more sustainable stays.
 
With our programme we will make sustainability more appealing and accessible to even the smallest accommodations by:
A free, large-scale, trusted and easy to understand sustainability label which matches traveller intent (see page 5 of our most recent Sustainable Travel Report) while reducing some key barriers for sustainability adoption for SME tourism accommodation providers (such as investment, information gaps or time to implement), increasing the likelihood that more accommodations can and will enhance their sustainability offering.  
Tailoring the sustainability journey and support provided to reflect the more limited resources and investment often available to SME accommodations.
Providing alternative approaches to assessing the sustainability of an accommodation e.g verified through a combination of innovative tools including customer reviews, on-site checks and AI, and thereby breaking down the cost barrier to certification.
 Since its launch date +116.000 properties now have the badge and hundred of thousands properties now participate in the Travel Sustainable program.  Going forward, we will continue to expand our existing Travel Sustainable Handbook and sustainability education programs for accommodations to tailor support based on their maturity level and local context.
 Measurable targets: 
- After establishing a baseline in 2022, we will announce a target for sustainable bookings made by our customers in 2023. 
- Launch and evolve the Travel Sustainable program for accommodations, cars, rides and flights by the end of 2023",Published

In order to advance on this path, DER Touristik will be requiring 100 % of the management and
property hotels to have Travellife certification by 2025.

Climate change is changing our world, making it one of the biggest threats of the 21st century. A first decisive step towards more climate-friendly travel is transparency: Emissions are calculated uniformly and presented for employees and customers, so that more climate-friendly travel could be offered and booked in the future. 

DER Touristik has therefore led the Centre for Sustainable Tourism together with Futouris (ZENAT) mandates to compile a market overview of the existing climate accounting systems. The overview showed that there are already good calculation bases for emissions from air traffic and methods that also determine the climate impact of other travel components. However, there is no climate accounting standard covering all elements of the tourism value chain and at the same time that would be accepted from as many partners as possible as an industry standard.

That’s why DER Touristik is now actively involved in Futouris’ industry project “Klimabewusst reisen”.

The private sector, more specifically the online travel sector, play a pivotal role when it comes to ensuring the adoption and application of some of the key principles of the tourism transition pathway. At the same time, the online travel industry can often be seen as hard to reach, engage or coordinate with.

The fact is, the online travel sector, such as online travel agents (OTAs) and meta-search platforms, dominate direct-to-consumer distribution whilst shaping and influencing consumer choice, driven by market demand and commercial objectives.

Ensuring their voice at the table is not only important but necessary in achieving dialogue with the public and private sectors as well as the online travel industry. 

Prerequisites

Engagement from the online travel industry is hard to gauge at present. However, it is also not immediately apparent if involvement and dialogue are widespread, representative or what might be defined as ‘actively engaged’.

It is hoped that through the DTTT’s Corporate Membership, we can create a channel for active dialogue between the online travel sector and European tourism policy, more specifically the priorities set out in the transition pathway.

Achieving this requires:
1. Establishing buy-in to the twin transition amongst corporate online partners in the form of alignment and recognition of sustainability standards.
2. Providing a conduit to the online travel sector to further the aims of the transition pathway alongside optional adoption and integration of coherent standards and principles.
3. Interest from corporate partners to actively engage in European tourism policy is key.
4. Incorporating policy dialogue and the representation of views as part of Corporate Membership.

Available through Corporate Membership offering both alignment on EU policy as well as the opportunity to shape and offer input.

To grow the supply of such content offerings, SmartGuide pledges to offer its Content Management System (CMS) to content creators self-service for free to publish digital guides as long as they meet the content quality requirements.  The CMS makes content creation fast and easy with smart functions, such as the import of readily available open data (OSM, Wikipedia) automated route generation, built-in DeepL translations, and natural text-to-speech audio being recorded as you type. The CMS allows anyone to publish a professional travel guide as easy as uploading a video on YouTube. 
Unlike traditional guides (such as Lonely Planet), SmartGuide pledges to leverage the whole community to create guides that cater to tourists and locals with different interests. For example, more than 10 diverse public and private sector authors already contributed to the Prague guide, ranging from tourism boards, museums, campus, tour guides, event organizers and tour operator.

SmartGuide covers over 600 destinations and aims to cover over 7,000 user-generated guides by 2025. That includes many small/rural destinations or attractions. For example in the Czech Republic, there are already more than 150 destination guides providing deeper understanding of the must-see places and inspiring domestic and international tourists to discover exciting places that they would not otherwise notice.",Published

198,11,"""DTTT Growth Membership - Open Access""

The Digital Tourism Think Tank is proud to have offered one of the leading platforms for thought leadership, industry insights, knowledge and trend analysis for more than a decade. Championing ‘Destination Transformation’ from the very outset, whilst embedding digitalisation as a core driver behind everything, including now a sustainable transition.

Over this time, we have also worked extensively with SMEs, indirectly brought into programmes and initiatives to train, develop and mentor business owners to embrace digital transformation. More recently, we have invested in a ‘Business Growth Membership’, a membership programme exclusively for SMEs, giving weekly insights, best practices, training and design resources to help businesses to remain competitive.

Recently, our goal has been ‘accessibility’, where we want to see as many SMEs as possible get access to these resources. To accelerate this aim, we now offer unlimited ‘Open Access’ to SMEs to Business Growth Membership to all Destination Evolve Members, through a simple enrolment link - shared with businesses in the destination.

Still in progress, we hope to further expand, shape and extend the relevance and accessibility of this resource together with members.

Prerequisites

Whilst we already have a range of DMO Members taking this plan, ‘alignment’ when it comes to buy-in and communication can be challenging.

To further this action, our goal is to focus on bringing DTTT Evolve Members together, as well as interested future members, with the aim of shaping, adapting and communicating resources even more effectively. We recognise that appeal, direct relevance and format are key barriers in ensuring SMEs fully engage.

This requires the following steps:

1. Identify opportunities to provide 'open access' membership to the DTTT Growth Plan, offering SMEs weekly case studies, best practices, insights, training resources and regularly updated tools and services.
2. Integration and/or alignment with existing EU-level resources, including pooling and expanding of existing training resources developed by other tourism organisations to provide an open platform
3. Funding model to be examined to consider where there may be opportunities to expand access, offering broader access together with association and corporate partners.
4. Creation of more practical and business-ready tools, such as always-on campaign planning tools, searchable business best practices and examples of digital and sustainable best practices.
5. Awareness-raising opportunities to introduce resources and create further interest or engagement, with the support of institutional partners.

Measuring Success

1. September 2023 - Announce and launch additional SME-focused tools, resources and features to drive direct action and uptake related to digitalisation and sustainability.

211,12,"Tourism and particularly tourism transport, contribute significantly to global environmental challenges, and effective policies to address these challenges remain largely absent. The research group Sustainable Tourism & Transport, therefore, strives for meaningful changes that contribute to a reduction of tourism’s environmental footprint by creating an impact on relevant tourism and environmental policy domains and on the awareness and practices of relevant organisations and the public at large. 

In our research, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap between the role of tourism and tourism transport in several global environmental challenges (notably climate change, but also biodiversity loss and health). We use our research to help businesses, consumers, and policymakers to take actions that effectively address these challenges.  

Our research adopts an integrated perspective on tourism that include all tourist flows to and from destinations (domestic and international, and all travel purposes, including business travel). We do so by measuring environmental impacts and developing mitigating policies and strategies, including assessing the societal and economic implications. The results are not only sound reports and articles but also innovative research approaches and tools based on a solid translation of science to the sector practices. 

To this end, we: 
1.	Measure and forecast the effects of tourism and tourism transport on the environment – particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – and possible consequences for consumers and businesses under current and alternative policy regimes. 
2.	Examine and influence processes of policy formation to guide policy actors in the development of alternative policies that effectively address specific tourism-related environmental challenges – particularly climate change. 
3.	Explore innovative approaches, measures, ideas, and new applications.
4.	Develop innovative tools – including serious gaming applications and enlightening translations of scientific outcomes for both policy-makers, the public, and business leaders – to assist policy-making.

To create impact with our research, we aim for scientific integrity, quality, credibility, societal relevance, and consistency. Staying true to science is central to our approach. We only engage in consultancy and research projects when there is a direct link to our own research track record or knowledge of the scientific state-of-the-art. And we aim for solid, pro-active science communication and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders across the political spectrum. 
We do so by:
1	Pursuing relevant research and consultancy projects in the tourism and environmental policy domain, with a focus on tourism-related transport issues. 
2	Integrate the findings in reports and outputs that are immediately relevant for stakeholders in this domain because they provide science-based directions to ongoing policy debates. 
3	Publishing the findings of our research in reputable, international peer-reviewed academic publications. 
4	Present and discuss our findings and hypotheses at international scientific and applied conferences and workshops. 
5	Engage with policymakers and the general public through mainstream media and other (social) media channels to address key societal challenges based on our research.

Current situation: By participation in the European Union’s mission named 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 (Mission for cities), the City of Zagreb plans to implement the activities under three priorities which encompass all phases of enhancement of single components contained in the measures. By increasing energy efficiency (“energy efficiency first”), by strongly stimulating the development and use of renewable energy sources, whose current share in energy balance of the City of Zagreb is almost insignificant, and by digitalisation of energy infrastructure (smart networks and remote reading of energy and water consumption), a systematic and synergistic transformation of the whole system will be ensured, as foreseen by the European Green Deal guidelines.
Stimulation of the introduction of zero-emission vehicles and the accompanying infrastructure will resolve one of the biggest problems in the area of the City of Zagreb, i.e. the continuously growing, negative, impact of emission gases from the traffic sector. Finally, considering the growing negative impact of climate changes, a series of activities concerning the adaptation to climate changes and local negative weather extremes has been defined in order to increase the resilience of the overall critical infrastructure and enhance the readiness of civil protection system. Urban planning, i.e. the processes of landscape planning in the City of Zagreb (PPGZ (Spatial Plan of the City of Zagreb), GUP (General Urban Development Plan), UPUs (Urban Landscaping Plans) etc.) are a very important legislative lever of the City, which has to be used by introducing energy and climate policies in those landscape planning documents in order to stimulate the green transition processes. 
Measure: Drafting documents which will define the activities, measures and projects by systematically and comprehensively identifying the needs of each single part of the infrastructure which impact the energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other detrimental compound emissions.

We have seen significant interest from Academia in the value of our membership resources, which offer a unique ‘practitioner’ lens on tourism industry trends and strategies.

In recognition of the value of Academia and Industry relations, DTTT Founder, Nick Hall, has recently been co-opted onto the board of the International Federation for IT, Travel & Tourism, the principal membership body representing leading scientific research on technology in tourism.

This cooperation has led to a joint commitment to building bridges between Industry and Academia, launching a joint membership proposition, establishing a podcast series ‘Beyond Tourism’s Horizon’ and commitment to further looking at joint research opportunities down the line.

We believe that this only touches the surface and there’s an opportunity to provide a more complete and compelling interface between the European tourism policy and initiatives. In particular, this interface can offer the potential to bring together some of the leading researchers in tourism, with the critical questions facing our industry - such as exploring the role and impact of horizon technologies or examining the deep learning that can be garnered through big data analysis and machine learning.

To further progress these aims, the Digital Tourism Think Tank is currently developing a series of catalogues, available within its membership platform, collecting a wide range of scientific papers, horizon technology research, cases and examples.

These critical research insights, together with the innovation methods we apply day-to-day built upon human-centred design principles are key to furthering our understanding of the opportunities and potential that exist in the digital and sustainable transition.

Prerequisites

Furthering this action requires detailed cooperation and this requires a strong commitment from partners who recognise the potential and want to be on board.

For this, we see the DTTT x IFITT Dual Research Membership as key. Not only does it provide a rich pool of resources, it also brings the academic community together, alongside industry, to jointly engage in exploratory scientific research set against some of the key aspects of the transition pathway.

This includes the following steps:

1. Develop an extensive catalogue of 'horizon technology' applications leveraging both advanced imaging and mixed reality experiences as well as data-derived solutions built on technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.
2. Engagement with the Academic community to offer scientific contributions through specific studies and papers, offering critical insight into potential applications for industry.
3. Growth of Research Membership to offer a more representative cross-section of leading institutions pursuing cutting-edge research in the field of technology in tourism.
4. A clear pathway to identifying funding opportunities and establishing strong prospects for consortia based on existing collaboration and complementary expertise.

Measuring Success

1. June 2023 - Launch of DTTT x IFITT ‘Joint Research Call’ to engage a wide network of institutions on the objectives and opportunities.
2. September 2023 - Growth in Research Membership uptake to achieve a representative network of European academic institutions.
3. January 2024 - Comprehensive and active dialogue and engagement from the academic community on the transition pathway with expertise and input alongside critical oversight.
4. March 2024 - Launch of extensive research catalogue, including an in-depth library of interviews and analysis from the research community.

288,20,"""The Transition Pathway: Spotlight on EU Tourism Policy' Podcast""

Over the past year, the Digital Tourism Think Tank has developed a range of in-depth podcast shows, offering a rich, expert-led perspective on the most critical matters impacting our industry. 

This includes podcasts such as ‘Leading Tourism’s Transition’ and ‘Beyond Tourism’s Horizon’ as well as a partner-led series of shows such as ‘Place-Based Innovation’ with Newcastle Gateshead Initiative and ‘Backstage Leadership Conversations’ with Abu Dhabi Tourism & Conventions.

The significance of European Tourism policy at this precise moment is particularly important to convey, where as an industry we are undergoing significant change and there’s an opportunity for tourism stakeholders to get behind the vision underpinning the transition pathway.

With the right level of support and partnership, we hope to launch a new podcast series shining a light on this, providing an outlet for tourism leaders to explore some of the ideas, the vision and the actions required to support the transition.

The hope is to launch a series where the voice and ambition for European tourism are given a platform, whilst the objectivity brought by the DTTT offers critical objective thinking coupled with perspectives and opinions which are representative of the diverging views, needs and activities of the wider sector in applying or supporting the transition.  


Prerequisites

Creating such a series requires buy-in, commitment and an interest in sharing and subscribing amongst the wider industry. 

Given the relevance and importance of both staying informed, engaging in dialogue and exploring some of the needs and priorities, we believe there is a strong appetite for this series, but it also requires interest, support and backing, especially at an institutional level.

Achieving this requires:

1. Launch a dedicated 'The Transition Pathway: Spotlight on EU Tourism Policy' podcast created in partnership with the European Commission, with the support of a range of European Associations representing a wide range of stakeholder voices and opinions.
2. Identify and highlight initiatives from the European Commission and reasons for stakeholders to become active participants, whilst also bolstering accessibility to knowledge on various European programmes and initiatives.
3. Spotlight on association initiatives through special guest series, where strategic partners such as European associations see the value in spotlighting their activities.
4. Setting aside dedicated resources and investment to plan, record, edit and publish the series
Identify clear interest and demand at a European level from institutional partners to support the initiative through partnership either direct or indirect, such as Association Membership.

Key Milestones

1. May 2023 - Announce podcast series alongside European Tourism Day and secure interest amongst stakeholders.
2. May 2023 - Record initial series exploring some of the topics and learnings through interviews with stakeholders.
3. September 2023 - Completion of inaugural series, with traction achieved and demonstrated through listenership and partner support and endorsement.
4. January 2024 - Commitment to long-term continuation of series, with buy-in and partnership from stakeholders at a European level with a clear resource justification (e.g. strong support or uptake of association memberships or a series sponsor).",Ready for publishing

A separate working group, consisting of representatives of industry organisations as well as the Ministry of EZK, CELTH and Breda University of Applied Sciences as one of the partner universities of applied sciences, has taken up this action. The parties work together – in a triple helix context – on a sustainable labor market, in which problems and solutions are identified and efforts are made to attract, train and retain (future) professionals for the domain in a sustainable manner. Since challenges and solutions can differ per sector and per region, insight, elaboration and implementation are needed at national, sectoral and regional levels.

Specifically, the parties raise the following points for attention, which should be involved in the approach and agenda development:

1. Provide data, knowledge and insight
2. Develop a common vision on sustainable employment practices
3. Develop a common vision on education, education and training
4. Ensure a joint approach to labor market communication.

Based on previous work done in the Next Tourism Generation project (https://nexttourismgeneration.eu), Breda University of Applied Sciences provided a research methodology to assess current skills gaps and future skills needs. The Skills Assessment Methodology (SAM) is a tool that has been designed to identify current and future workforce skills at a national or regional level. As a key element of the Blueprint Strategy, the NTG Skills Assessment Methodology was developed as a research-based, structural mechanism for the analysis of rapidly changing skills and skills needs to develop strategies for addressing skills gaps in the EU Tourism Sector. The focus of the SAM are the skillsets necessary for the future of the workforce, specifically: digital, green and social skills.

The benefit of the SAM is that it can be used at multiple levels: regional, national or international, adding flexibility and improving feasibility. Although it was developed for assessing digital, green and social skills needs in five tourism subsectors, it can be easily expanded and used to address skills needs in other tourism ecosystems.

The SAM has been used in eight European countries to create a skills profile of the tourism sector and to formulate a response strategy. This resulted in the production of eight skills reports on current skills gaps and future skills needs. The SAM will be rolled out in at least five other European countries in the coming four years. 

Additionally, new Skills Assessment activities will be carried out throughout the PANTOUR project where Breda University of Applied Sciences leads the research approach on Skills Intelligence. The goal is to ensure a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that feed into sector-wide curricula, integrating work-based learning in the tourism ecosystem and addressing urgent skills needs.

The sustainability of the PANTOUR project is partly based on developing a European Quality Framework that partner countries and other EU members can use to standardise cross-institute recognition of relevant modules and training content. 

Breda University of Applied Sciences develops and shares knowledge on current skills gaps and future skills needs, with an objective to develop a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that SMEs, educational institutions and other training providers can use to develop tourism-related curricula and practical courses to meet the most urgent needs. This Skills Intelligence Mechanism would be available for tourism training providers (as open access) by the year 2023.",Published

EFFAT reminded the PfST support structures that given the fact that in most EU Member States the social partners, i.e. employers and trade unions, are involved in vocational education and training, any new structures created under the PfST need to build on or at least involve the ongoing VET work and its actors.

EFFAT regularly attends the PfST Coordination Group meetings, and, together with HOTREC, is member of the PfST Management Committee in the category of social partners.

Europe happens to be the oldest and largest spa market in the world within a health care system as a tradition. Some EU countries face more challenges regarding waiting lists for spa/medical procedures, while others have capacity for more patients. Nevertheless, the use of thermal spas and visit to spa destinations should be promoted within the EU, particularly the post-covid recovery concept that has already proven to render results across Europe. 
Adapting current health care educational systems in Europe with the goal to close workforce gaps. Implementing doctors’ exchange programmes and attracting non-European medical students as tomorrow’s skilled workforce and medical tourism ambassadors should be stimulated. Some EU countries learned that attracting foreign students enhance image in medical tourism and build up succession planning of medical staff. It also reinforces liaisons between the countries and welcomes new global opportunities for medical tourism on global level. Moreover, medical staff is a scarce resource in the European Union while its population is getting older and requiring even more medical attention.

With this in mind, the law points to correct a situation between one of its most punished collectives. The room service workers in the hospitality sector are the most suffered collective in Hostelry, as they represent the 27% of the accident rate in the whole tourism sector. Additionally, this collective is strongly feminized, with almost no men among them. Most of their injuries are musculoskeletal disorders associated with overexertions. Correcting this situation will represent a measure of social justice for the part of labour, but also for the part of gender equality.

Current situation: The service Accessible Zagreb is a developmental project aimed at mapping and providing information on the accessibility of surfaces and facilities in the area of the City of Zagreb. The service is available through web pages and as a mobile application, and it provides information about the accessibility of various facilities from public, private and civil sectors. The base currently comprises approximately 2,500 facilities categorised as accessible, inaccessible or partially accessible. There are three levels of accessibility: access to the facility, entrance to the building and interior of the building. Also, each facility contains a photo gallery showing accessibility status, and the service is integrated with Google Maps for easier navigation and travel planning. The application Accessible Zagreb currently contains eight categories (culture, catering, education, sports, administration, services, social welfare and health) and is available in Croatian and in English and German languages.
The service has also developed an accessibility map which, integrated with Google Maps service, shows an accessible pedestrian route for the disabled within a mapped area which currently encompasses the wider centre of the City, while the navigation recognises/avoids the following obstacles or disturbances on sidewalks: stairs, high kerbs, uneven ground surfaces, insufficiently wide sidewalks, excessive side walk slopes. The service is mostly used by the citizens of Zagreb, but it should be made visible to tourists and visitors of the City. 
Measure: Examining the needs which would be additionally interesting to disabled visitors and tourists and those with special needs, translating the Service into other global languages and additional promotion towards eminent markets.

V4AInside has been developed based on accessibility studies and analysis of the needs expressed by customers with specific needs and/or disabilities during national and international projects and ""best practices"".
For which tourists does V4AInside collect information? 
The system collects information useful to: people with disabilities (permanent or temporary), motor, sensory limitations (blind and deaf), food allergies and intolerances, the elderly, diabetics, dialysis, obese people and families with small children. 
For which nationalities of tourists is Village for all Inside able to provide information?
The system collects objective information, measurements, data, dimensions, etc... and these are of an objective information and as such are of support to people of any nationality.
Is V4AInside a national accessibility assessment system?
The system does not evaluate accessibility but collects data that allow people to evaluate the facilities according to their abilities/aspirations and for this reason it can be used in any country. It does not evaluate according to the regulations in force in any of the European and non-European countries and the platform is multilingual.
Who can use V4AInside?
The application has been developed to be used by qualified inspectors who have followed a specific training course organized by Village for all®. Does V4AInside guarantee accessibility?
The system allows you to verify the quality of the information collected by the Village for all inspectors. The information collected is used to understand the organisation of the structure, services and spaces, so that each customer, based on their specific needs, disabilities or needs is able to assess whether they meet their request for accessibility.
 For which tourist facilities does V4AInside collect information? Hotels, restaurants, bathing establishments, tourist villages, museums, palaces, monuments, etc... are to date 28 different types of facilities on which this application can be used.
How does V4AInside help improve accessibility?
At the end of the audit, thanks to a specially developed algorithm, a list of interventions and possible improvements (removal of architectural and organizational barriers such as menus for coeliacs, communication such as communication/information systems for the deaf and/or blind, etc.) aimed at improving hospitality for all customers is drawn up.
What accessibility standards does V4AInside suggest?
The reference point for the identification of improvement interventions for the structures reviewed are the ISO 21542:2011 Building construction standard. Accessibility and usability of the built environment, with some improvements compared to the standards.
V4AInside also guarantees: 
•	assurance of the quality of the information 
•	containment of the possibility of error 
•	guarantees the same result regardless of the detector 
•	creation of a recognisable and reliable information standard for the end user and the professional user (TO/adv) 
•	reduction of costs and time taken into account 
•	reduction of the time taken to disseminate the results 
•	final output allows the surveyed structures to increase their accessibility and at the same time to raise awareness of the entrepreneurs involved 
•	pluri-lingual embodiment 
•	allows the execution of multiple contextual audits, e.g. Italian Hospitality Brand - V4A® 
•	the application is easily implementable with other evaluation paths
