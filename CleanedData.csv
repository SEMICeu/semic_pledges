0,1,"Actually we as an association are still pretty much at the beginning due to the pandemic which took the better part of our ressources. What we want to provide is a proper guideline for STR how to achieve, maintain and develop a sustainable business.
Additionally our business is very fragmented and diverse. We have privat hosts with one or only a few apartments, professional hosts, local property managers of all sizes, platforms for STR (local, national and international level) and service providers for the industry of all kind.
Our target for 2025 is to achieve that guideline. 

Nonetheless Some of our members have implemented a variation of measures like strategies for a sustainable transmission, climate compensation, specific advertising for sustainable accomodations, using local supplies, charging stations for e-cars, using renewable energy and CO2-neutral construction, tools to minimise negative impact of tourism on neighbourhoods etc."
1,1,"EFFAT welcomes the Commission Proposal for a Regulation on data collection and sharing relating to short-term accommodation rental services COM(2022) 571 published on 7 November 2022. Such regulation is a first important step to ensure fair competition and a level playing field between all providers of accommodation services.

The collection of full and comprehensive data on short-term rental hosts and guests, and the obligation of short-term rental platforms to provide these data to national competent authorities, as well as the sharing of the data at European level, will enable Member States to better regulate the sector in a harmonised approach.

EFFAT, together with its social partner HOTREC, has been advocating for many years for a level playing field and fair competition in hospitality and tourism, asking that the same rules have to be applied to all providers of accommodation services, with regard to  e.g.
- Legislation
- Fiscal obligations
- Food hygiene rules
- Registration and permits for operation
- Licensing to serve alcohol
- Statistical measurement of the economic activity
- Safety and security
- Employees’ rights and protection
- Consumers’ rights
- Right to proper living conditions of residential neighbourhoods
- Zoning in urban planning, e.g. the distinction between residential and commercial properties
(see Joint EFFAT-HOTREC Statements on the Sharing / Platform Economy of December 2015 and November 2019)

EFFAT will 
- in 2023-2024, follow the legislative procedure for the Regulation through European Parliament and Council of Ministers
- during this legislative procedure, regularly keep its national member organisations updated about the legislation in the making, by reporting at least 2 times per year on the progress made and agree on measures to be taken by EFFAT and national affiliates
- once the Regulation is finally adopted, ask national member organisations to monitor the transposition of the Regulation in their countries and to push for its proper implementation, and to report at least 2 times per year about the actions taken and the progress made 
- follow the work of the Single Digital Entry Points Coordination Group composed of Member States' national coordinators
- continue to address the issue of short-term accommodation rental services in the Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee Horeca, by putting it on the agenda of the 2 Working Group and 1 Plenary meetings per year, and to undertake joint actions with its social partner HOTREC whenever necessary
- continue to advocate for further measures to guarantee a level playing field and fair competition in hospitality and tourism, by compelling short-term accommodation rental services to comply with the same rules and obligations as other accommodation providers

The actions described above shall contribute to achieving the aim that all short-term accommodation rental platforms have applied the obligations of the Regulation by 2025, or at least 2 years after its coming into force."
2,1,"HOTREC calls for a level playing field and fair competition in the EU for the hospitality sector. We advocate for a specific instrument that addresses the complex and diverse regulatory questions presented by the STR industry. The main objectives include the introduction of a robust and efficient EU-wide registration system; or outlining clear and comprehensive data-sharing requirements. HOTREC made its first call for a level playing field for hoteliers vis-à-vis STR in 2014 and has since then produced several brochures and policy papers addressing how to introduce rules which are adapted to STR services and necessary regulatory requirements. 

We commit to issue and disseminate during the course of 2022 our position and research study among the EU institutions as well as with members of HOTREC and other stakeholders via our website. We will continue to share our position on the matter including via meetings with interested parties and stakeholders in order to reach a fair framework on the topic. Through our internal working group on STR held twice a year as well as during our biannual General Assemblies, we’ll continue to gather information about STR developments in EU countries and share the latter with the EU stakeholders during the designing phase of the STR regulation. We intend to continue monitoring STR developments during the implementation phase of the STR initiative and act as an information sharing platform between our members"

4,1,"Sphere Travel Club contributes to a flourishing and transparent STR market by transparently controlling the quality and offer on its platform, opening up the market for exchange among holiday home owners. We pledge to curate a collection of properties that have outstanding quality, only correct information and owners of trust, so as to ensure that clients receive what they are offered and to avoid any type of fraud through a trustful environment.
Our target for 2025 is to have at least 15 properties in each member state of the EU.

Furthermore, many holiday properties stand empty up to 80% of the year and are only sparsely used by their owners, thereby representing a considerable environmental impact. One of our core aims is to provide a community of trust that allows more people to access unused holiday home properties through the sharing economy, thereby optimising the existing resources and positively contributing to the environment.
Our target for 2025 is to have saved 10.000 weeks from going to waste."

. INTEL·LITUR: 
With a clear orientation towards data culture in the companies, Catalonia is promoting a platform where the client of the Catalan Tourist Board (CTB) (companies in the Catalan tourism sector) can find all the key information they need regarding products and markets. 
The platform, within the B2B portal of the CTB, consists of two parts, one part with quantitative information in PowerBI format and a virtual library with documents of interest generated by the CTB.
The information is structured according to the life cycle of the trip or according to the needs of the company: attracting customers, gaining customer loyalty, increasing productivity, increasing profitability or maintaining the company's staff.
Target: the first phase should be online by the end of 2023 (quantitative data), the second one by the end of 2024 (virtual library).

. TOT LAB: 
Catalonia is part of TOTLAB, NECSTOUR's knowledge laboratory.
We are working this 2022 on a project of indicators of sustainability in the territory focused on the so-called 4D, diversification of the tourist offer, territorial deconcentration of tourism, deseasonalization of the arrival of tourist flows and spending (Despesa in Catalan).
The aim of this work is to establish an index for measuring the correct implementation of the wise growth strategy proposed in our Marketing plan 18-23.
Target: Each year we will work on a topic that can be shared with the other participating members of TOTLAB, and so the other members should do."

13,3,"Our Intermediterranean and Islands Commissions, together with several technical partners and Tourism Observatories in the Mediterranean, are working to create a Network of Mediterranean Observatories on Sustainable Tourism (Med NSTO). This work is being supported by an EU territorial cooperation project, BEST MED, funded by Interreg Med Programme. This project is producing an info hub and will deliver a road map describing the next steps to create the NSTO by the end of 2022. 

Our organization, including some of our member regions (e.g. in Italy and Spain) in particular are especially engaged in this process and will keep working after the project’s conclusion to set up this Network of observatories with the idea to bring together the main parties to share ideas, techniques and tools on data/indicators, and to build multi-level cooperation in order to seek better joint solutions and work in a common direction. 

Hopefully for 2025 we will have consolidated the current embryo of network of observatories, linking up with INSTO from UN WTO, the Glasgow Declaration and other initiatives/EC actions, indeed contributing to the EU Pathway and topic 3 and in particular to harmonised data collection, improving access to data for official statistics and including key sustainability indicators on the basis of the work already done in the past and in concrete projects such as BEST MED, Mitomed +, Co-Evolve, among others. 

It’s difficult to look further than 2025. This is a work in progress that will depend on the will and resources of all involved parties and on the support coming from EU funding streams which we are already applying for to the relevant cooperation programmes in the framework of open call for proposals (e.g. call for governance projects Euro-Med Interreg). 

If this experience works, we don’t exclude to assess the possibility to replicate it in other sea basins or in any case to extrapolate useful results for the benefit of other EU regions within our membership/EU Tourism transition pathway implementation. 

On a more general note, if any discussion on data/indicators is foreseen at EU level involving the regions our organization will be happy to liaise and provide representatives/experts from our member regions and their observatories. Also as a network we have a vocation to establish synergies with the foreseen tourism stakeholder collaboration platform and other platforms and initiatives."

15,3,"Tourism intelligence and innovation one of six action programs of the Strategic Tourism Plan for Navarra 2018-2025. This plan formulates the need to improve the measurement of Tourism in Navarra, including sustainability.
To meet these needs, the Navarra Tourism Observatory were been created to be at service for both the public administration and the sector. Since establishing the observatory, we have made considerable advancements and in 2019, we entered the UNWTO International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). As an INSTO member, we commit to submit a yearly report monitoring 11 mandatory issue areas.

In 2021, we joined NECSTouR and its the Tourism of Tomorrow Lab. Through our participation in this network, we aim to further improve tourism statistics.
Strategic objectives:
Within the framework of the Navarra Tourism Action Plan 2020-2022, within Strategic Line 6: Tourism intelligence, the following objectives have been established:
- Monitor Navarra's tourist offer in its progress towards digital transformation, competitiveness, sustainability, quality and inclusion
- Increase knowledge about tourism flow and demand
- Measurement of social sustainability in the territory
- Monitoring of national and international trends and competitors
The degree of achievement of the same will be assessed through the monitoring of these indicators:
- Number of new data sources incorporated
- Variation in spending at destination
- Variation in indicators of sustainability, digital transformation, competitiveness and inclusion.
These objectives are in alignment with those proposed in:
- The Strategic Plan for Tourism 2018-2025, in which the ""Creation of the Navarra Tourism Observatory to improve the transfer of market intelligence knowledge to the sector as a whole"" was determined.
- And at the international level with the SDGs 2020: Objective 8 Decent work and economic growth; Objective 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; Objective 12 Responsible production and consumption)
Its development is also supported by the Smart Specialization Strategy of Navarra S4 (2021-2027 update), in which sustainable tourism is established as a thematic priority and the development of lines of work such as the ""Digital transition in the intelligence system of tourist markets. Collection of data on demand, preferences and behaviors for decision-making in tourism marketing”."

19,3,"Investing into a comprehensive research on the European health tourism that is based on primary datas and would include the private sector and then accelerate further destination development and economic impact of health tourism. The study report on health tourism (European Parliament, 2017) and the report on health tourism (UNWTO & ETC, 2018) imply that increasing the share of health tourism may reduce tourism seasonality, improve sustainability, and labour quality, and help to reduce healthcare costs through prevention measures and decreased pharmaceutical consumption. However, both reports lack primary data, and they did not consider the needs of the private sector.
Investing into developing high-quality data bases and benchmarking across all segments of the health tourism sector in Europe. Big data are the key to measure success in the digital era, but it requires intense efforts from the public and private sector. Health sector gathers significant data that are treated individually by each service provider. Benchmarking would allow performance measurement of marketing effects, and boost competitiveness and quality of services of the European health tourism offer. It would permit better inclusion of telemedicine and improve patients’ experience, including tourists and European citizens.
Measurable result: 
-within two years, a joint event with the UNWTO with a focus on health tourism and to present the economic impact of health resorts in one of our member states based on primary data
-in the next 2 years annual event in the EU Parliament for the health tourism industry
-part of the annual congress of ESPA to publish the medical results of preventive treatments in at least 3 countries as best case
- the create one innovation Award for a sustainable medical spa/spa town or spa hotel and to show focus on sustainbale methods in all other Innovation Awards categories

33,3,"SETTING UP A UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF TOURISM
Current situation: Currently, there is no system for measuring the sustainability of tourism development. Several institutions (City of Zagreb, City of Zagreb Tourist Board, Croatian Bureau of Statistics etc.) measure mainly statistical data on the territory of the City of Zagreb, in order to monitor the arrivals, overnight stays, number of visitors and similar. So far, these institutions have not monitored tourism by taking into account sustainability. The setting up of a uniform system for monitoring the sustainable development of tourism, such as a digital platform putting together all reports on a yearly basis, would allow the monitoring of tourism industry sustainability and that would ensure timely detection and minimisation of possible negative impacts, which may be caused by tourist operations at the destination. The indicators of sustainable development of tourism have multiple functions, including the examination of past changes and the prediction of the future ones, which contributes to better understanding of complex processes at the destination. Correctly determined sustainable development indicators will lead to quality and informed management and more efficient measuring, and will as well represent a better basis for taking decisions concerning sustainable tourism development and better management of urban resources.
Measure – collection of information from various institutions and publicly available sources, such as citizen, visitor, tourist and tourist industry polls
Objective – setting up, by 2023, a uniform system for monitoring the sustainable development of the City of Zagreb tourism"

One of the initiatives over the past 5 years has been to systematize, automate and visualize basic statistics and indicators in tourism in a digital tool, accessible to all. This turned to be a role model and inspiration for the development of a national tool launched by the end of 2021 by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth.
Furthermore, within the framework of the BI-Syd Partnership, we have initiated a development pilot in collaboration with a leading phone company to see how we can use mobility data to measure flows in nature based areas. We are currently at the end of the data collecting phase and beginning the development phase. Here we want to test and identify suitable data as indicators to measure and control flows and volumes in order to achieve more balanced flows in attractive areas with high density of visitors.
Coming work is that we have committed to collaborate nationally (national and regional organizations) to find common indicators for sustainable destinations. This work has begun in October 2022 and aims to complete a form of how to optimize the work to be done and find a good collaborating method.
The overall target is to ensure that Tourism in Skåne by 2024 regularly contributes to solving societal challenges linked to the SDGs with the aim of reaching a more balanced flow of visitors and to achieve that Skåne is a more vital destination all year round by 2030 the latest."

After 10 months of participatory consultations during which all the territory’s stakeholders exchanged their ideas for the tourism and events of tomorrow, Bordeaux Metropole has developed its roadmap up to 2026.

This document is the result of a synthesis of the ideas exchanged during the 9 workshops. Bordeaux Tourist & Conventions Office and Bordeaux Métropole worked hand in hand to offer a panel of 32 detailed actions with precise objectives, success indicators, a timetable and identification of key partners. A maximum of parameters were taken into account and calculated to ensure the proper implementation of each action.

Here are the objectives that the destination is committed to meeting:
– Improving the offer and accompanying it through its environmental transition so that it is adapted to the new customers’ expectations and to the environmental commitments of Bordeaux Métropole, to go back to pre-Covid tourism performances by renewing and creating customer loyalty thanks to the upgrade and transformation of the offering.

– Developing local tourism to guarantee a balance for the territory, extending touristic seasons, incentivising dialogue between residents and visitors by offering to the metropolis’ inhabitants new discoveries and stay in and around Bordeaux Métropole area.

– Developing business tourism alongside with the territory’s sectors of excellence to always use better our dedicated infrastructures – those which have been built recently or those for which investments have been planned – and to increase economic impacts for the area regarding main sectors and skills

45,4,"""Sustainable, Digital Transition Methodology""

Working with a wide range of tourism organisations in different member states, our methodology and approach are always evolving. 

What’s the goal? To identify trends ahead of the curve, incorporate priorities driven by values and develop methods which bring expertise, intelligence, insight and co-design together - shaping informed decisions and outcomes. 

Our work is underpinned by openness and transparency, which is why we are committed to openly publishing our methodology and approach. As we undergo the next iteration of our strategic methodology, we are committed to incorporating the principles underlined in the transition pathway, in particular, the twin transition represent key pillars.

We believe these are profoundly important to consider and apply as underlying principles in a broad spectrum of strategic needs, from initiating innovation systems to setting multi-year transformation strategies in tourism.

Specifically, this will take form as follows:

1. Incorporating the Transition Pathway for Tourism, as well as the Sustainable, Digital Transition Methodology as a dual set of principles into strategic development work, including destination strategies and trend analysis.

2. Creation of a new design-led workshop series ""Smart. Sustainable. Destination Design."" based on the principles of the Transition Pathway to help stakeholders undertake a comprehensive evaluation of their strategic objectives.

Prerequisites

The keys to success are in ensuring all members of the Digital Tourism Think Tank’s Knowledge Team are fully trained on and aware of the Transition Pathway. In particular, it requires a detailed understanding of the twin transition and its implications for tourism at a strategic and practical level.

Further measures required:

- Update strategic methodology to incorporate ‘Sustainable, Digital Transition’. [DTTT Internal]
- In-depth training of the knowledge team on incorporating Sustainable, Digital Transition into the strategic process. [DTTT Internal]
- Awareness-raising actions amongst the EU tourism community, including institutional-level support [Public Sector Stakeholders]
- Demand generation amongst potential clients for strategies, workshops and actions applying methodology [Public Sector Stakeholders]

Key Milestones

- June 2023 - Incorporate Sustainable, Digital Transition into DTTT Methodology
- September 2023 - Launch and promote methodology, raising awareness of the need, opportunity and potential gain
- January 2024 - Establish successful projects either underway or with completed outcomes, including clear goals and objectives aligned with the priorities set out in the twin transition.
- May 2024 - Share outcomes with European Stakeholders, demonstrating the need, opportunity and ambition through case studies and debate"

62,4,"DRAFTING A TOURISM DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Current situation: The Development Strategy of the City of Zagreb, as the City's main strategic development document, which includes tourism to a minor extent, became insufficient for further growth and development of sustainable tourism in the City of Zagreb. Also, there is no clearly defined direction of further development of tourism, based on sustainability principles. Since tourism, in its scope, closely interacts and depends on other sectors, such as transport, agriculture, health, digitalisation, landscaping and others, it is necessary to prepare a strategy aligned with sustainable policies for the other sectors and representing a starting point for embracing and further development of the issues and measures touching upon tourism sector in the preparation of their plans.  
So far, the development of tourism was mainly based on the exploitation of the existing tourist basis, without strategic investments in the area of tourism. For that reason, the Strategy will also analyse those city resources that can represent an axis of further development of sustainable tourism, such as city assets, city infrastructure, transport, architecture, cultural heritage, local population etc., together with the plan aimed at resolving the problems defined in the programme.  By defining specific advantages and resolving specific challenges of the destination, tourist potential of the available area will be considered, as well as its basis, in terms of resources and attractions. Possible infrastructural, demographic, institutional and similar development limitations will be analysed, especially taking into account the principles of sustainable development, the developmental needs and potential of tourism. The City of Zagreb wants to enable further development of sustainable tourism in its area, based on the sustainable use of urban resources, by respecting and establishing a balance between tourism and the City or its citizens.
Measure – drafting of a document based on sustainability principles which will include all the Zagreb tourism industry key stakeholders, i.e., the public, private and civil sectors. 
Objective – allowing for a strategic framework for the challenges of social, business and environmental sustainability of further growth of tourism in Zagreb by 2023."

Totally nearly 8 million euros of state funding is allocated for development of DMO-s for years 2022-2025. 

Expected results of the program are:
- Satisfaction of visitors with the quality of tourism services in the region has risen
- Visitor satisfaction for the availability of information online has risen
- There is an optimal number of DMOs in Estonia (5-8) that have optimal size (400-600 enterprizes per DMO)
- Regional tourism cooperation network is satisfied with the DMO operating models
- Addition of sustainable tourism companies
- Number of products based on the network and corresponding to the messages of the Estonian brand in the field of tourism has risen
- Development activities organized by the DMO for the service providers in the area are useful
- Estonian Tourism Board is satisfied with the cooperation with DMO-s"
81,5,"As a newly established NTO has been functioning only year and a half, the aim is to strengthen its  position on domestic and international target markets.  From this point of view building and development of the organizational structure of NTO is essential. The next step will be creation of thematic tourism product management. As a target for 2025, NTO plans to prepare 4-8 thematic product lines for marketing and sales activities. In the process of creating the product lines we make efforts to include the principles of sustainability – as using regional products and sources, supporting local communities, creating authentic offers and deliverying exceptional tourism experience.
It will be supported by effective networking of DMO´s, professional organisations and tourism stakeholders. 

In order to ensure collaborative governance of tourism destinations, we support cooperation of professional tourism organizations at all levels (NTO, 8 regional tourism organizations and 39 district tourism organizations - DMOs). In the field of the cooperation of DMOs, we encourage them to become a member of the professional association of DMOs which can provide them opportunities for collective action and communication toward government entities and other tourism stakeholders on regular basis. Another key objective is to provide support for increase in number of active DMCs and incoming sales entities to enable the increased sales of tourism products.  

All actions mentioned above shoud be supported by cooperation between all tourism entities,  including the public sector and local residents, as well. At least once a year a professional gathering organized by NTO is planned to provide opportunities to discuss on various topics and to improve activities by information exchange of best practices from abroad and from Slovak regions. A regular online education trainings are planned for DMO´s on selected topics.
The only way how to succeed is to ensure sustainable cooperation between all tourism stakeholders."

83,5,"Our approach is twofold: enable collaborative destination governance mechanism and empowering them to measure tourism success according to values beyond traditional volumes:

1)	Through the personalised tourism-data consultancy delivered by the Tourism of Tomorrow Lab to at least 4 pilot regions in 2022,  these regions who will acquire experience in measuring tourism impacts as a structural decision making policy will trigger change to less experienced destinations through the collaborative knowledge framework offered through the network. As mentioned, through the project « Support to the tourism ecosystem: towards a more sustainable, resilient, and digital tourism” we expect to easy the integration of sustainable tourism measurability, more and more progressively, into the destination management models.

1.	By transforming the “Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit” principles into policy measures and projects. NECSTouR signed the Barcelona Declaration in April 2018.  Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit which aims at balancing the uses of cultural heritage and other territorial assets by the residents, the visitors, and the tourism businesses. It proposes five key principles addressing aspects related to governance, sense of belonging, promotion, measurability, and interpersonal relations to be endorsed by tourism as well as the cultural and other related stakeholders. It shows the consensus of key stakeholders committed to demonstrate what tourism and cultural heritage sectors can achieve by working more closely together, for the benefit of European citizens and cultural heritage as well as businesses, visitors, and destinations, in line with the SDGs. This is why NECSTouR Regions keeps identifying examples of turning principles into policy measures and projects. First, through an event in Barcelona in September 2022, aiming at generating exchanges, reflections, and debates on how the wellbeing of the local community and the climate actions needs are driving the transformation of the tourism model and ecosystem, moving from sustainable to responsible and regenerative tourism. The event will reflect the legacy of the Barcelona declaration “Better places to Live, Better Places to Visit” in NECSTouR members’ strategies, actions, and initiatives. Equally important is the development of interregional pilot projects to build methodologies and test them on the ground. This will be possible if European funding is obtained."

- data available and used to redefine destination promotion and management strategies"
88,5,"A collaborative Visitor Management Plan for Scotland:

Post lock-down, many local communities felt unprepared to deal with the large increase in visitors, particularly day visitors, campers and campervans. To address some of the negative impacts on communities, VisitScotland led a successful, large-scale collaboration aimed at engaging stakeholders and visitors on responsible enjoyment. 

Launched in March 2021 with a Responsible Tourism Visitor Pledge, the partnership includes National Park Authorities, Police Scotland, nature, land and transport bodies, as well as local authorities, to provide a robust and practical strategy with short, medium and long-term actions and benefits. 

Leading a collaborative, cross-organisation approach to marketing and communication, a fully realised campaign has now been delivered to provide information, guidance and education around outdoor access, camping, fire & water safety, motorhomes & campervans, littering & waste. Activity encourages greater access to, and enjoyment of, Scotland's outdoors – especially amongst new audiences – so we all #RespectProtectEnjoy. 

VisitScotland and partners will continuously update information on the Plan’s actions and impacts in a publicly available strategy framework and action log: 

https://www.visitscotland.org/about-us/what-we-do/working-in-partnership/visitor-management-plan. 

This includes reporting at the regular virtual summits of the collaborating stakeholders. As visitor management activity is wide ranging and involves many partners, each organisation involved has its own specific targets and KPIs, all aligned to the overarching strategy. 

The Visitor Management Action Plan is regularly monitored to ensure progress is being made and activity is supporting the strategy. Success is measured through reduction in issues relating to littering, fires, water safety, anti-social behaviour and inconsiderate parking.

A strategic framework pulls together the current and planned actions into a cohesive and aligned direction of travel towards a vision of how the visitor experience will develop over a 10-year period. The collective action log records progress against strategic pillars - covering not just VisitScotland as the official tourism organisation, but all partners involved in delivery of the visitor management strategy. 

A future focus for the visitor management work is on three areas: digital solutions (e.g. monitors of visitor volume); camping and motorhome management and infrastructure; and transport solutions.  These will complement the ongoing work on education, promotion of key messages and support for park rangers (which have been critical to the success of the work to date by engaging on-site with visitors and providing advice and guidance).

For all partners, the role of technology in visitor management and visitor experience will become increasingly important as we progress, with current projects already providing learnings for future."
89,6,We are already working on two use cases in mobility in Austrian Alps regions (Schladming and Zell am See). With the use of mobile provider data we are solving the problem of visitor management in the high season. One project (in Schladming) will result in offering a bus ride up to the mountain instead of private cars. The other project is about management of car traffic given the limited number of parking slots on the top of the mountain. Both projects will be completed this year (2023). Next year the pilot project can be rolled-out in other regions.
90,6,"AViTeM will contribute to this topic by enhancing its ongoing cooperation work through EU territorial cooperation projects with other organisations, local/regional/national institutions, associations, businesses across Europe and the Mediterranean. For what concerns sustainable mobility, we will explore opportunities to build projects that allow to test solutions based on behavioural science to influence more responsible behaviours when it comes to tourism mobility.
By 2025/2030, we expect to have produced and tested behavioural science-based solutions related, among other topics, to sustainable tourism mobility. These solutions will be brought to the attention of policy makers at different levels, for their scale-up and adoption in public policies. We will also disseminate them to mobility practitioners for their replication.
> What is behavioural science and why is it relevant?
""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) 
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential.
For example, in the sector of mobility we could test solutions that, after the observation of behaviours, use the related congitive biases to orient the choice of sustainable mobility options, for example by making these the default options."

105,6,"""12.5% Sustainable Aviation Fuel by 2030""
The use of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) is key to decarbonise the industry in the short to medium term.  SAF can deliver significant CO2 emissions savings and is a promising technology to pursue the achievement of the EU Green Deal’s objectives.  For these reasons, Ryanair committed to an industry-leading 12.5% SAF use in 2030.  In April 2022, we announced a partnership with Neste, a SAF supplier, to power approx. one third of our flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend.  This SAF will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%, supporting Ryanair’s Pathway to Net Zero by 2050 decarbonisation goals.  Ryanair has already significantly advanced this commitment by partnering with Trinity College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, which was launched in April 2021.  It is composed by 11 engineers and scientists focused on researching SAF, zero carbon aircraft propulsion systems and noise mapping for low-noise aircraft fleets.

108,6,"STIMULATING SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY
1.Cyclo-tourism and cycling infrastructure
Current situation: In the City of Zagreb there are currently 237,709 m of cycle lanes and sidewalks, while the share of cycle traffic in the overall city traffic is 3%. There are also 54,140 m of roads where shared traffic has been introduced. The existing cycling infrastructure of the City of Zagreb is not adequate (traffic continuity is not adequately managed, kerbs are still undropped, signals are irregularly installed), for which reason there is need for continuous investment, education and promotion of everyday bicycle use. To reach that objective, Zagreb is currently adopting an operation plan for the development of cycling traffic and an activity plan concerning the education and promotion of everyday bicycle use for moving within the city. 
Measure – In the coming period measures and activities will be implemented in order to increase pedestrian and cycling traffic, public transport share, and reduce the share of motor vehicle traffic. Another 3,000 m of cycle lanes will be constructed, especially those separated from pedestrian sidewalks and motor vehicle transport; other forms of shared transport, such as bike sharing and car sharing, will be stimulated as well.
Objective – Long-term objectives include the building of complete cycling infrastructure in the area of the City of Zagreb in order to allow quality and safe movement of cyclists. One of strategic objectives in the future development of urban and suburban traffic on the territory of the City of Zagreb and its wider area significantly relates to sustainable development stimulation through the introduction of cycling traffic in the traffic system. The other objectives, inter alia, include: an 8% increase of the cycling traffic share in the city traffic, growth of cycling surfaces due to the introduction of shared traffic on the pavement and 30 km/h zones in the wider area of the City.
2.Widening of the car-free zones in the very centre of the City
Current situation: The area of the centre of the City of Zagreb extends on a surface of approximately 6.5 km2, while 81,669.92 m of streets are without car traffic. Examples of good practice have shown that the elimination of road traffic and the widening of pedestrian zones increase air quality, reduce traffic jams and noise levels, revive city centres, which, at the end of the day, contributes to the quality of life of all citizens, especially those who live in the City centre. The plan to extend car-free zones would stimulate citizens to a more frequent use of healthier means of transport, such as public transport and bicycles.  
Measures: Gradual extension of car-free zones in the very centre of the city, by transforming the existing streets open to vehicle traffic into car-free streets.
Objective: Reducing road traffic and increasing the number of pedestrian zones (in metres) in the centre of the City of Zagreb by 10% by 2025.
3.Transformation of the City of Zagreb into a smart city
Current situation: Projects and solutions aimed at resolving various citizens’ problems function as isolated points without being interconnected, such that it is not rare that they duplicate or that their full potential is not used; their data are not consolidated or integrated into a single system, which makes it difficult to citizens, and the overall public sector, to navigate in a large amount of information. A recently launched digital infrastructure sector project is the platform Zagreb Smart City Hub, which represents a simple tool for citizens which allows them to find relevant information about “smart” projects in the City area. The platform gives citizens an additional opportunity to communicate about key decisions and get involved in the strategic decision-making, while various information is gathered in a single point. 
Measure: Further development of ZSCH platform in terms of overall integration and interconnection of all databases from the Zagreb City area.
Objective: Full digitalisation of business, a single database and cooperation with citizens, which will ensure enviable quality of life and numerous savings, new business models, economic growth, and finally a high living standard for citizens. Each citizen and business entity will have their digital identity fully integrated with the European service provision system, i.e. with e-Citizens system, such that everyone who stays or lives in Zagreb, either as a business user or a tourist, will effectively be local in digital terms."

For what concerns circularity in the hospitality industry, we will keep exploring opportunities to build projects that allow to test solutions based on behavioural science to enhance a smarter use of resources and a more responsible behaviour of hosts.
By 2025/2030, we expect to have produced and tested behavioural science-based solutions related, among other topics, to circularity in the hospitality industry. These solutions will be brought to the attention of policy makers at different levels, for their scale-up and adoption in public policies. They will also be disseminated to hospitality practitioners who may be interested to replicate them.
> What is behavioural science and why is it relevant?
""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) 
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential. 
For example, in the hospitality industry there can be room to test solutions based on behavioural science to reduce food waste or plastic use, or optimise the use of water and energy."

118,7,"ETQA has developed a database that contains (should contain) the tourist businesses that have a territorial quality mark if and only if they have passed a self-certification test regarding the ETQ criteria. Speaking of tourism, one must not limit oneself to quality accommodation and restaurant companies.

 It is necessary to go towards the cellars with DOP wines and the farms with certified products; tourism services which, however, do not have any level of certification other than that of reviews.

Concrete target for 2025-2030 Tourist SMEs across Europe in the whole value to be trusted by consumers, providing a European Fidelity Card which will reflect a set criteria related to sustainability, green and quality. 

However, all this holds up if, given the availability of companies, promotion can be promised, which is the thing that most interests them. Difficult topic but which could lead to the creation of a POINTS CARD (fidelity) which is loaded when you buy a product, sleep or eat. Adherence to the card involves certain requirements that all companies must meet. This is something that tends to cost even little because the promotion is done by the certified structures themselves.
This ind of card does not exist so far for the small tourist companies but only for the big chains (more industrial level)"
119,7,"The Balearic Islands's Government has fixed in its tourism sector law (Ley 3/2022 de medidas urgentes para
la sostenibilidad y la circularidad en el turismo) the obligation for every hospitality company to integrate
circularity into its governance system, by defining and setting the minimum content of a Circular Strategy. 
No sector can be circular on its own. Despite this, Tourism is in Balearic Islands the main economic motor (it
accounts itself the production of 25% of its GDP directly, and more than 40% accounting indirect effects),
and therefore absorbs most of the private investment in our archipelago. With this in mind, the policymakers
have designed this obligation in order to boost circular transition, as the hospitality sector has sufficient
traction potential (a long value chain and a huge GDP proportion of Balearic Economy), to make shift its
providers and customers into circularity.
This Circular business strategy consists in 2 parts:
A Circular Evaluation. Before planning our transition to circularity, it's mandatory to understand the gap
between the current state of the business and the optimal circular conditions. To do so, each establishment
must monitor a list of 16 mandatory Key Performance Indicators, grouped under 4 categories or priority areas: Water, Energy, Materials and waste and Alimentation. This circular evaluation has to be updated annually.
Circular Planification: Once the establishment has done its evaluation, it has to commit to several
objectives to improve its indicators, and to do so elaborate five years forward planning, plotting new
investments, processes and formation to achieve them. This planification must be updated, at least, once
every 5 years.
The spirit of this measure is to shape our sector's investment toward circularity, helping the community to
achieve some of the SDG's at the same time the company is improving it's efficiency and reducing its waste
production and resource consumption, boosting also the diversification of Balear Economy..

The measurable target is that 100% of tourist acommodation companies in the Balearic Islands to have a Circular Business Strategy by 2024 and to update it every 5 years."

It is a joint process of ministry, CELTH, industries, entrepreneurs, NBTC, DMOs and cities, regions. The roadmap shows the fullest possible overview of challenges, opportunities and obstacles we face as a sector on the road to climate-neutral tourism. The course document will be translated into concrete actions and tools for tourism stakeholders from 2023 onwards. In 2023 we aim to reach 100 destinations on the importance of sustainability and at least 5 cities will develop their own roadmap for sustainable tourism with concrete actions."
123,7,"The Tourism Cloud Platform and the Destination Network Open Platform and Ecosystem were designed to disrupt the value chains of global market-dominating platforms, such as online travel agents, which can take between 60-80% of the GOP (Gross Operating Profit) from hospitality and tourism providers. This is not economically sustainable for the destination and their businesses.

The deployment of digital transformation in destinations ensures that destinations and their hospitality and tourism businesses can regain control of their visibility, digital presence, reputation, communication, and distribution. This enables them to rapidly recover from the pandemic, become more resilient, and reduce their dependence on these market behemoths. As a result, more tourism spend will be retained within the destination, leading to the circularity of tourism services in the destination.

The goal for 2025 is to work with at least 50 tourism authorities and destinations to make this feature available to them."

Green transition of tourism companies :
We commit to operating our business sustainably and building a culture of sustainability. 
We are leading by example by setting carbon reduction targets in line with climate science guidance and by empowering our people to make sustainable choices in their day-to-day work. Using 2019 as a baseline, we have used the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) criteria for a 1.5C future to develop short and medium-term reduction targets.
 Measurable targets:
- 95% reduction in scope 1* & 2** emissions by the end of 2030 from 2019 baseline 
- 50% reduction in scope 3*** emissions by the end of 2030 from 2019 baseline 
- Achieve net-zero by 2040
 
*Scope 1 emissions are natural gas used in offices, fuel for leased company vehicles
**Scope 2 emissions are electricity from offices and data centers
***Scope 3 emissions are purchased goods/services, business travel, employee commuting

Green Transition of tourism SMEs:
We are committed to making it easier for travellers to book more sustainable trips. Supporting tourism accommodations in developing their sustainability programmes, while recognising those who have already made significant efforts to improve the sustainability of their operations. By showcasing these efforts on our platform (increasing the supply of more sustainable travel options), we aim to make it easy for travellers to book more sustainable travel. Today only a small number of  tourism accommodations have invested in existing sustainability certifications.
 
We have launched the  Travel Sustainable Programme that has 2 central components: 
1) Educating and raising awareness amongst tourism accommodations on their impact in the environment they operate in. Initially 32 sustainability practices have been independently validated as impactful. We have been working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Travalyst, Sustainalize and other sustainability experts to share what properties can do to make positive change in the industry. Through the Booking.com Sustainability Handbook, available in 30 languages, Booking.com supports partners to understand which practices may make more sense to them, what impact they will have; sharing tips and best practices. The objective is to get accommodations started on sustainability.
2) A  badge and filter on our product. The badge is awarded automatically to accommodations who already have one of 37 3rd party certifications we accept as part of our framework. For those properties that have implemented sustainability programmes or adopted sustainability practices but cannot afford or commit to the requirements of a 3rd party certification, our programme will award a badge if they reach a sustainability impact threshold, assigned per continent and independently validated as part of our framework.  Travel Sustainable is an evolving programme, designed to make sure that no accommodation however small, is left behind in the sustainability transition. It will continue to evolve to drive forward the sustainability agenda.
We believe the badge will provide credible recognition of impactful sustainability efforts for more properties worldwide and provide travelers with a transparent, consistent and easy-to-understand way to identify a wider range of more sustainable stays.
 
With our programme we will make sustainability more appealing and accessible to even the smallest accommodations by:
A free, large-scale, trusted and easy to understand sustainability label which matches traveller intent (see page 5 of our most recent Sustainable Travel Report) while reducing some key barriers for sustainability adoption for SME tourism accommodation providers (such as investment, information gaps or time to implement), increasing the likelihood that more accommodations can and will enhance their sustainability offering.  
Tailoring the sustainability journey and support provided to reflect the more limited resources and investment often available to SME accommodations.
Providing alternative approaches to assessing the sustainability of an accommodation e.g verified through a combination of innovative tools including customer reviews, on-site checks and AI, and thereby breaking down the cost barrier to certification.
 Since its launch date +116.000 properties now have the badge and hundred of thousands properties now participate in the Travel Sustainable program.  Going forward, we will continue to expand our existing Travel Sustainable Handbook and sustainability education programs for accommodations to tailor support based on their maturity level and local context.
 Measurable targets: 
- After establishing a baseline in 2022, we will announce a target for sustainable bookings made by our customers in 2023. 
- Launch and evolve the Travel Sustainable program for accommodations, cars, rides and flights by the end of 2023"

the correct investments in tourism and connected sectors are funded (cross-sectoral impact: traffic, construction, energy, food, medicine, etc.). It generates sustainable revenue and is securing higher life quality of life of the local residents. 

TIM has already been tested and used in 36 locations around Europe (Black Sea area, Slovenia, Danube 
region, etc.) and is available on the European market. Until 2025 we plan to make 40-50 new TIM assessments around Europe. Which will result in the take-up of data-driven destination management tools and in increased offer of personalised tourism services.

DER Touristik promotes and characterises certified products and makes it easier for customers to choose and book. Wherever possible, sustainability standards are implemented within the supply chain, to protect both humans and the environment. 

Therefore, DER Touristik has set itself the goal of 25 % of the hotels in the core portfolio being certified with a Sustainability certificate according to the GSTC standard. 
In order to advance on this path, DER Touristik will be requiring 100 % of the management and
property hotels to have Travellife certification by 2025. 

Also for the companies in the destinations, DER Touristik wants to ensure a good sustainability standard and therefore the so-called DMCs (Destination Management Companies) complete a Travellife certification by 2025. 

Climate change is changing our world, making it one of the biggest threats of the 21st century. A first decisive step towards more climate-friendly travel is transparency: Emissions are calculated uniformly and presented for employees and customers, so that more climate-friendly travel could be offered and booked in the future. 

DER Touristik has therefore led the Centre for Sustainable Tourism together with Futouris (ZENAT) mandates to compile a market overview of the existing climate accounting systems. The overview showed that there are already good calculation bases for emissions from air traffic and methods that also determine the climate impact of other travel components. However, there is no climate accounting standard covering all elements of the tourism value chain and at the same time that would be accepted from as many partners as possible as an industry standard.

That’s why DER Touristik is now actively involved in Futouris’ industry project “Klimabewusst reisen”. By the end of October 2022, Futouris members develop in cooperation with the Institut for Sustainable Development Tourismus GmbH and the German Travel Association DRV a standard for climate accounting of Travel to find industry-wide support. 
On the basis of this standard, CO2 emissions will be reported uniformly for all journeys in the future. 
This is how customers can make an informed decision and the industry’s absolute emissions 
substantially and measurably lowered."
185,10,"""Corporate Pledge Programme""

The private sector, more specifically the online travel sector, play a pivotal role when it comes to ensuring the adoption and application of some of the key principles of the tourism transition pathway. At the same time, the online travel industry can often be seen as hard to reach, engage or coordinate with.

The fact is, the online travel sector, such as online travel agents (OTAs) and meta-search platforms, dominate direct-to-consumer distribution whilst shaping and influencing consumer choice, driven by market demand and commercial objectives.

Ensuring their voice at the table is not only important but necessary in achieving dialogue with the public and private sectors as well as the online travel industry. 

Prerequisites

Engagement from the online travel industry is hard to gauge at present. However, it is also not immediately apparent if involvement and dialogue are widespread, representative or what might be defined as ‘actively engaged’.

It is hoped that through the DTTT’s Corporate Membership, we can create a channel for active dialogue between the online travel sector and European tourism policy, more specifically the priorities set out in the transition pathway.

Achieving this requires:
1. Establishing buy-in to the twin transition amongst corporate online partners in the form of alignment and recognition of sustainability standards.
2. Providing a conduit to the online travel sector to further the aims of the transition pathway alongside optional adoption and integration of coherent standards and principles.
3. Interest from corporate partners to actively engage in European tourism policy is key.
4. Incorporating policy dialogue and the representation of views as part of Corporate Membership.

Available through Corporate Membership offering both alignment on EU policy as well as the opportunity to shape and offer input.

Measuring Success

1. June 2023 - Draft and share a paper for corporate partners on the importance and opportunity of engagement on the transition pathway.
2. September 2023 - Successful canvassing of interest amongst existing corporate partners and potential future partners.
3. November 2023 - Initiate representation activities to convey interests in the online travel sector and communicate progress and opportunities related to the transition pathway.
4. January 2024 - Demonstrate positive demand generation through corporate membership growth and active engagement.
5. March 2024 - Seek buy-in to a set of principles, values or actions in the form of a corporate pledge connected with the transition pathway."

For example, more than 10 diverse public and private sector authors already contributed to the Prague guide, ranging from tourism boards, museums, campus, tour guides, event organizers and tour operator.

SmartGuide covers over 600 destinations and aims to cover over 7,000 user-generated guides by 2025. That includes many small/rural destinations or attractions. For example in the Czech Republic, there are already more than 150 destination guides providing deeper understanding of the must-see places and inspiring domestic and international tourists to discover exciting places that they would not otherwise notice."

198,11,"""DTTT Growth Membership - Open Access""

The Digital Tourism Think Tank is proud to have offered one of the leading platforms for thought leadership, industry insights, knowledge and trend analysis for more than a decade. Championing ‘Destination Transformation’ from the very outset, whilst embedding digitalisation as a core driver behind everything, including now a sustainable transition.

Over this time, we have also worked extensively with SMEs, indirectly brought into programmes and initiatives to train, develop and mentor business owners to embrace digital transformation. More recently, we have invested in a ‘Business Growth Membership’, a membership programme exclusively for SMEs, giving weekly insights, best practices, training and design resources to help businesses to remain competitive.

Recently, our goal has been ‘accessibility’, where we want to see as many SMEs as possible get access to these resources. To accelerate this aim, we now offer unlimited ‘Open Access’ to SMEs to Business Growth Membership to all Destination Evolve Members, through a simple enrolment link - shared with businesses in the destination.

Still in progress, we hope to further expand, shape and extend the relevance and accessibility of this resource together with members.

Prerequisites

Whilst we already have a range of DMO Members taking this plan, ‘alignment’ when it comes to buy-in and communication can be challenging.

To further this action, our goal is to focus on bringing DTTT Evolve Members together, as well as interested future members, with the aim of shaping, adapting and communicating resources even more effectively. We recognise that appeal, direct relevance and format are key barriers in ensuring SMEs fully engage.

This requires the following steps:

1. Identify opportunities to provide 'open access' membership to the DTTT Growth Plan, offering SMEs weekly case studies, best practices, insights, training resources and regularly updated tools and services.
2. Integration and/or alignment with existing EU-level resources, including pooling and expanding of existing training resources developed by other tourism organisations to provide an open platform
3. Funding model to be examined to consider where there may be opportunities to expand access, offering broader access together with association and corporate partners.
4. Creation of more practical and business-ready tools, such as always-on campaign planning tools, searchable business best practices and examples of digital and sustainable best practices.
5. Awareness-raising opportunities to introduce resources and create further interest or engagement, with the support of institutional partners.

Measuring Success

1. September 2023 - Announce and launch additional SME-focused tools, resources and features to drive direct action and uptake related to digitalisation and sustainability.
2. November 2023 - Incorporation of a bold proposition for start-ups and SMEs to become more actively engaged, via open-access membership, in future events, awards and other engagement activities.
3. January 2024 - Demonstrate significant growth amongst DMO, Public Sector and Institutional partners in Evolve Membership with active dissemination of benefits to industry.
4. March 2024 - Incorporate tourism SME opportunities in X. Design Week, with the launch of SME-focused training and development initiatives."

This allows them to onboard about 1000 hospitality and tourism businesses per week, in order to help them rapidly recover from the pandemic, become more resilient, independent from market-dominating foreign platforms, taking back control of visibility, digital presence, and distribution in order to restore economic sustainability.

Through this approach, Rainmaker provides easily accessible best practice, peer learning, and networking opportunities for SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) in the destination. This allows SMEs to access the knowledge and resources they need to improve their businesses, learn from the experiences of others, and network with other tourism industry professionals. This in turn positively impacts the SMEs and the destination by providing a more efficient and effective tourism industry, leading to increased economic sustainability and growth.

The goal for 2025 is to work with at least 50 tourism authorities and destinations to make this feature available to them."

211,12,"Tourism and particularly tourism transport, contribute significantly to global environmental challenges, and effective policies to address these challenges remain largely absent. The research group Sustainable Tourism & Transport, therefore, strives for meaningful changes that contribute to a reduction of tourism’s environmental footprint by creating an impact on relevant tourism and environmental policy domains and on the awareness and practices of relevant organisations and the public at large. 

In our research, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap between the role of tourism and tourism transport in several global environmental challenges (notably climate change, but also biodiversity loss and health). We use our research to help businesses, consumers, and policymakers to take actions that effectively address these challenges.  

Our research adopts an integrated perspective on tourism that include all tourist flows to and from destinations (domestic and international, and all travel purposes, including business travel). We do so by measuring environmental impacts and developing mitigating policies and strategies, including assessing the societal and economic implications. The results are not only sound reports and articles but also innovative research approaches and tools based on a solid translation of science to the sector practices. 

To this end, we: 
1.	Measure and forecast the effects of tourism and tourism transport on the environment – particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – and possible consequences for consumers and businesses under current and alternative policy regimes. 
2.	Examine and influence processes of policy formation to guide policy actors in the development of alternative policies that effectively address specific tourism-related environmental challenges – particularly climate change. 
3.	Explore innovative approaches, measures, ideas, and new applications.
4.	Develop innovative tools – including serious gaming applications and enlightening translations of scientific outcomes for both policy-makers, the public, and business leaders – to assist policy-making.

To create impact with our research, we aim for scientific integrity, quality, credibility, societal relevance, and consistency. Staying true to science is central to our approach. We only engage in consultancy and research projects when there is a direct link to our own research track record or knowledge of the scientific state-of-the-art. And we aim for solid, pro-active science communication and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders across the political spectrum. 
We do so by:
1	Pursuing relevant research and consultancy projects in the tourism and environmental policy domain, with a focus on tourism-related transport issues. 
2	Integrate the findings in reports and outputs that are immediately relevant for stakeholders in this domain because they provide science-based directions to ongoing policy debates. 
3	Publishing the findings of our research in reputable, international peer-reviewed academic publications. 
4	Present and discuss our findings and hypotheses at international scientific and applied conferences and workshops. 
5	Engage with policymakers and the general public through mainstream media and other (social) media channels to address key societal challenges based on our research. 

The Sustainable Tourism research group currently consists of six dedicated researchers, who supervise over twenty master’s and undergraduate students, are commissioners of another ten to fifteen thesis students, conduct five to ten projects, and publish many scientific and professional papers annually.

Current situation: By participation in the European Union’s mission named 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 (Mission for cities), the City of Zagreb plans to implement the activities under three priorities which encompass all phases of enhancement of single components contained in the measures. By increasing energy efficiency (“energy efficiency first”), by strongly stimulating the development and use of renewable energy sources, whose current share in energy balance of the City of Zagreb is almost insignificant, and by digitalisation of energy infrastructure (smart networks and remote reading of energy and water consumption), a systematic and synergistic transformation of the whole system will be ensured, as foreseen by the European Green Deal guidelines.
Stimulation of the introduction of zero-emission vehicles and the accompanying infrastructure will resolve one of the biggest problems in the area of the City of Zagreb, i.e. the continuously growing, negative, impact of emission gases from the traffic sector. Finally, considering the growing negative impact of climate changes, a series of activities concerning the adaptation to climate changes and local negative weather extremes has been defined in order to increase the resilience of the overall critical infrastructure and enhance the readiness of civil protection system. Urban planning, i.e. the processes of landscape planning in the City of Zagreb (PPGZ (Spatial Plan of the City of Zagreb), GUP (General Urban Development Plan), UPUs (Urban Landscaping Plans) etc.) are a very important legislative lever of the City, which has to be used by introducing energy and climate policies in those landscape planning documents in order to stimulate the green transition processes. 
Measure: Drafting documents which will define the activities, measures and projects by systematically and comprehensively identifying the needs of each single part of the infrastructure which impact the energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other detrimental compound emissions. 
Objective: Setting up and implementing the measures, activities and projects which will save energy, improve air quality and finally enhance the quality of life."

Flows is an innovative solution for data-driven local destination management to monitor carrying capacity and well-being. FLOWS enable GDPR-compliant advanced analyses and forecasts of tourist movements based on anonymised data from a multitude of different sources (traffic counters, data from mobile operators, freely accessible Wi-Fi networks, tourist tax, etc.). A simple user interface will display traffic flows: excessive traffic loads, seasonal deviations, entrances/exits to the destination, movement within the destination, etc. It displays the analyses in the selected time interval (year, month, week, day), forecasts based on historical data, weighted by special parameters (weekend, weather, national or holiday in other countries, etc.). FLOWS analysis enables us to predict the tourist flows and make the right decision for supporting the development of balanced and geographically distributed sustainable tourism. With FLOWS, we can influence the tourist flows and their behaviour. Flows technology and knowledge were already used in the T4.0 Alpine Flows project by setting up a footfall monitoring system for the visit to hiking trails. The system will collect up-to-date data on visits to support the sustainable rerouting of Alpine flows.

We have seen significant interest from Academia in the value of our membership resources, which offer a unique ‘practitioner’ lens on tourism industry trends and strategies.

In recognition of the value of Academia and Industry relations, DTTT Founder, Nick Hall, has recently been co-opted onto the board of the International Federation for IT, Travel & Tourism, the principal membership body representing leading scientific research on technology in tourism.

This cooperation has led to a joint commitment to building bridges between Industry and Academia, launching a joint membership proposition, establishing a podcast series ‘Beyond Tourism’s Horizon’ and commitment to further looking at joint research opportunities down the line.

We believe that this only touches the surface and there’s an opportunity to provide a more complete and compelling interface between the European tourism policy and initiatives. In particular, this interface can offer the potential to bring together some of the leading researchers in tourism, with the critical questions facing our industry - such as exploring the role and impact of horizon technologies or examining the deep learning that can be garnered through big data analysis and machine learning.

To further progress these aims, the Digital Tourism Think Tank is currently developing a series of catalogues, available within its membership platform, collecting a wide range of scientific papers, horizon technology research, cases and examples.

These critical research insights, together with the innovation methods we apply day-to-day built upon human-centred design principles are key to furthering our understanding of the opportunities and potential that exist in the digital and sustainable transition.

Prerequisites

Furthering this action requires detailed cooperation and this requires a strong commitment from partners who recognise the potential and want to be on board.

For this, we see the DTTT x IFITT Dual Research Membership as key. Not only does it provide a rich pool of resources, it also brings the academic community together, alongside industry, to jointly engage in exploratory scientific research set against some of the key aspects of the transition pathway.

This includes the following steps:

1. Develop an extensive catalogue of 'horizon technology' applications leveraging both advanced imaging and mixed reality experiences as well as data-derived solutions built on technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.
2. Engagement with the Academic community to offer scientific contributions through specific studies and papers, offering critical insight into potential applications for industry.
3. Growth of Research Membership to offer a more representative cross-section of leading institutions pursuing cutting-edge research in the field of technology in tourism.
4. A clear pathway to identifying funding opportunities and establishing strong prospects for consortia based on existing collaboration and complementary expertise.

Measuring Success

1. June 2023 - Launch of DTTT x IFITT ‘Joint Research Call’ to engage a wide network of institutions on the objectives and opportunities.
2. September 2023 - Growth in Research Membership uptake to achieve a representative network of European academic institutions.
3. January 2024 - Comprehensive and active dialogue and engagement from the academic community on the transition pathway with expertise and input alongside critical oversight.
4. March 2024 - Launch of extensive research catalogue, including an in-depth library of interviews and analysis from the research community.
5. June 2024 - Demonstration of tangible outputs through active collaboration initiatives between Industry and Academia aligned with the transition pathway."

The project aims – by providing concrete and innovative tools to improve the relationship between industry, education system and public authorities – to respond to the future skills needs in this economic sector, so remarkable for the GDP and the employment levels of the European Union, but at the same time highly subject to rapid technological changes and continuous transformations in the business models and the organization of production factors.
So, the NTG project partnership – involving 7 trade associations, 6 universities and 1 organization, representing 8 European countries – is engaged to build and implement a structural and permanent mechanism to bridge (and minimize) current and future skills shortages, establishing a Blueprint Strategy for Sectoral Skills Development to respond to the fast changing and increasing gaps in digital, green and social skills sets, also in light of the profound transformation that occurred in the tourism industry following the sudden and disrupting appearance on the scene of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In order to ensure that the results of the project can be effectively relevant and useful for the next generation of educators, decision makers, investors, companies, institutions, students and workers in the field of tourism and hospitality, the sectoral skills are analysed and developed with the year 2030 as a landmark on the horizon.
Based on the results achieved through the NTG project, Federturismo Confindustria's concrete pledge is to promote awareness of transition needs and sharing of best practices among its members with the goal of having reached each member for active knowledge exchange at least 3 times a year until 2025 and beyond."

It is planned that awareness raising with regards to the skills need for twin transition in tourism will become integral to our European initiatives that are planned for submission in 2023. At the moment we plan to apply for funding coming from Erasmus+ prgramme. We consider raising awarenes as key as we are skeptical that current attention given to twin transition skills within tourism eco-systems will suffice to meet the 2030 and 2050 targets of the EU. Thus, additional efforts are needed to increase both the educational demand and supply of the twin transition skills among the tourism workforce. Our awareness raising will take place in higher education, VET and the corporate part of the involved tourism eco-systems. Involved eco-sytem will most likely by Szeged region (Hungary), Tirol region (Austria), Helsinki region (Finnland).

Target Measures for 2025:
Raising wareness for the twin transition skills needs in tourism across 3+ EU countries, involving 15+ organisations from the field of tourism from 3+ tourism eco-systems and reaching 200+ individuals working in tourism.

288,20,"""The Transition Pathway: Spotlight on EU Tourism Policy' Podcast""

Over the past year, the Digital Tourism Think Tank has developed a range of in-depth podcast shows, offering a rich, expert-led perspective on the most critical matters impacting our industry. 

This includes podcasts such as ‘Leading Tourism’s Transition’ and ‘Beyond Tourism’s Horizon’ as well as a partner-led series of shows such as ‘Place-Based Innovation’ with Newcastle Gateshead Initiative and ‘Backstage Leadership Conversations’ with Abu Dhabi Tourism & Conventions.

The significance of European Tourism policy at this precise moment is particularly important to convey, where as an industry we are undergoing significant change and there’s an opportunity for tourism stakeholders to get behind the vision underpinning the transition pathway.

With the right level of support and partnership, we hope to launch a new podcast series shining a light on this, providing an outlet for tourism leaders to explore some of the ideas, the vision and the actions required to support the transition.

The hope is to launch a series where the voice and ambition for European tourism are given a platform, whilst the objectivity brought by the DTTT offers critical objective thinking coupled with perspectives and opinions which are representative of the diverging views, needs and activities of the wider sector in applying or supporting the transition.  


Prerequisites

Creating such a series requires buy-in, commitment and an interest in sharing and subscribing amongst the wider industry. 

Given the relevance and importance of both staying informed, engaging in dialogue and exploring some of the needs and priorities, we believe there is a strong appetite for this series, but it also requires interest, support and backing, especially at an institutional level.

Achieving this requires:

1. Launch a dedicated 'The Transition Pathway: Spotlight on EU Tourism Policy' podcast created in partnership with the European Commission, with the support of a range of European Associations representing a wide range of stakeholder voices and opinions.
2. Identify and highlight initiatives from the European Commission and reasons for stakeholders to become active participants, whilst also bolstering accessibility to knowledge on various European programmes and initiatives.
3. Spotlight on association initiatives through special guest series, where strategic partners such as European associations see the value in spotlighting their activities.
4. Setting aside dedicated resources and investment to plan, record, edit and publish the series
Identify clear interest and demand at a European level from institutional partners to support the initiative through partnership either direct or indirect, such as Association Membership.

Key Milestones

1. May 2023 - Announce podcast series alongside European Tourism Day and secure interest amongst stakeholders.
2. May 2023 - Record initial series exploring some of the topics and learnings through interviews with stakeholders.
3. September 2023 - Completion of inaugural series, with traction achieved and demonstrated through listenership and partner support and endorsement.
4. January 2024 - Commitment to long-term continuation of series, with buy-in and partnership from stakeholders at a European level with a clear resource justification (e.g. strong support or uptake of association memberships or a series sponsor)."

292,20,"Digitization in healthcare is a very important topic and the pandemic has shown the lack of this capacity. This urgently needs to be improved and the online information between therapists and patients/guests needs to be designed more optimally. This also applies for the bookings in spa resorts and in all areas of  aftercare.
Defining digital tools that help destinations and companies in this health tourism sector to make a self-assessment and diagnosis in terms of competitiveness and sustainability in order to optimize the positive impact of this sector on local development and employment creation and also as a base for medical information. Smart technology could motivate and stimulate both public and private investments and thus revitalize some thermal destinations.

All tourisms associations and destinations have been sent an introductory e-mail and an appeal to commit their pledges, also a public (virtual) seminar was organized by Ministry to introduce the pathway and call for commitments and participation in the co-implementation.

Estonian government supports destinations (through Enterprise Estonia) in making the green transition by offering the Green Destinations standard, which enables the systematic development of sustainable tourism in the destination. At the moment we have conducted a pilot in 7 destinations: Saaremaa, Hiiumaa, Järva County, Lahemaa, Tartu, Pärnu County and Rakvere. All of them achieved the Green Destinations Award, which required the development of a standard of 100 criteria and the preparation of an application with extensive evidence gathering. Lahemaa reached the gold level; Hiiumaa, Saaremaa, Järva County and Tartu silver and Pärnu and Rakvere bronze level. As a result of the audit, they have a report with recommendations for further development activities. So, the work in these destinations continues.
We offer to green destinations additional support through networking activities to encourage joint green product development. At the same time, we are also preparing for new destinations to join in 2023.
Secondly, in 2021-2023, we have supported sustainable development activities within the framework of cooperation projects of destinations, in frames of which we contribute to the development of sustainable services. For the years 2022 - 2025, there are planned additional resources for the sustainable development of destinations.
The Energy and Climate Plans that are being worked out by destinations in these cooperation projects are certainly one of the most important strategic documents that will make a significant contribution to the greening of destinations.

An ongoing project (2020-2023) addresses an important topic of accessible tourism. The collaboration leads to knowledge exchange, curricula and course development and learning for all stakeholders, and will impact both future education and research.  

At Metropolitan University Prague, several courses have been developed and innovated to raise awareness about issues relating to accessible tourism among tourism students. Learning more about accessible tourism and potential barriers to travelling can be one of the approaches. Other approaches could be to get students to practically plan tourist travel or a conference for a larger group of persons with reduced mobility. The teaching of accessible tourism does not exist to such an extent at any other university in the Czech Republic.  Metropolitan university Prague´s students will have the opportunity to gain experience with the issue of people with disabilities. Graduates of the study program at MUP can use the knowledge of accessible tourism in their future jobs and contribute to the development of this socially responsible sector.

310,22,"The tourism and hospitality sector is structurally unsuccessful in attracting staff and retaining staff in the long term. The turnover in the sector is relatively high, which has increased further due to the COVID pandemic and the temporary closure of large parts of the sector. In addition, the student intake for education within the hospitality domain (Leisure, Tourism & Hospitality domain) is falling at the VET and Higher Education level.

The Dutch Taskforce for Cooperation in the Leisure, Tourism and Hospitality Sector has included 'Developing a (qualitative and quantitative) knowledge infrastructure for human-capital issues in the leisure, tourism and hospitality sector' in its new Action Agenda. A separate working group, consisting of representatives of industry organisations as well as the Ministry of EZK, CELTH and Breda University of Applied Sciences as one of the partner universities of applied sciences, has taken up this action. The parties work together – in a triple helix context – on a sustainable labor market, in which problems and solutions are identified and efforts are made to attract, train and retain (future) professionals for the domain in a sustainable manner. Since challenges and solutions can differ per sector and per region, insight, elaboration and implementation are needed at national, sectoral and regional levels.

Specifically, the parties raise the following points for attention, which should be involved in the approach and agenda development:

1. Provide data, knowledge and insight
2. Develop a common vision on sustainable employment practices
3. Develop a common vision on education, education and training
4. Ensure a joint approach to labor market communication.

Based on previous work done in the Next Tourism Generation project (https://nexttourismgeneration.eu), Breda University of Applied Sciences provided a research methodology to assess current skills gaps and future skills needs. The Skills Assessment Methodology (SAM) is a tool that has been designed to identify current and future workforce skills at a national or regional level. As a key element of the Blueprint Strategy, the NTG Skills Assessment Methodology was developed as a research-based, structural mechanism for the analysis of rapidly changing skills and skills needs to develop strategies for addressing skills gaps in the EU Tourism Sector. The focus of the SAM are the skillsets necessary for the future of the workforce, specifically: digital, green and social skills.

The benefit of the SAM is that it can be used at multiple levels: regional, national or international, adding flexibility and improving feasibility. Although it was developed for assessing digital, green and social skills needs in five tourism subsectors, it can be easily expanded and used to address skills needs in other tourism ecosystems.

The SAM has been used in eight European countries to create a skills profile of the tourism sector and to formulate a response strategy. This resulted in the production of eight skills reports on current skills gaps and future skills needs. The SAM will be rolled out in at least five other European countries in the coming four years. 

Additionally, new Skills Assessment activities will be carried out throughout the PANTOUR project where Breda University of Applied Sciences leads the research approach on Skills Intelligence. The goal is to ensure a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that feed into sector-wide curricula, integrating work-based learning in the tourism ecosystem and addressing urgent skills needs.

The sustainability of the PANTOUR project is partly based on developing a European Quality Framework that partner countries and other EU members can use to standardise cross-institute recognition of relevant modules and training content. 

Breda University of Applied Sciences develops and shares knowledge on current skills gaps and future skills needs, with an objective to develop a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that SMEs, educational institutions and other training providers can use to develop tourism-related curricula and practical courses to meet the most urgent needs. This Skills Intelligence Mechanism would be available for tourism training providers (as open access) by the year 2023."
311,22,"EFFAT is signatory to the Pact for Skills for Tourism (PfST) and has informed its member organisations about the setting up of national or regional skills partnerships.

EFFAT reminded the PfST support structures that given the fact that in most EU Member States the social partners, i.e. employers and trade unions, are involved in vocational education and training, any new structures created under the PfST need to build on or at least involve the ongoing VET work and its actors.

EFFAT regularly attends the PfST Coordination Group meetings, and, together with HOTREC, is member of the PfST Management Committee in the category of social partners.

In November 2023, EFFAT, in cooperation with its social partner HOTREC, is planning an event in the context of the European Year of Skills, to present joint recommendations on vocational education and training and skills  in the hospitality sector, inviting DG EMPL and DG GROW and a wide range of hospitality-tourism stakeholders.

312,22,"We are signatories to the pact of skills for tourism and fundamentally believe just transition principles. We see the pact for skills as an opportunity to adapt workers to a changing economy and tourism industry as part of this just transition. When jobs are being lost, skills should be provided to adapt workers to new jobs in tourism and beyond and this is our primary concern.

Together with EFFAT and UNI Europa, we will meet annually in the EU Trade Union Liaison Committee on Tourism (ETLC) where the pact for skills will be discussed. This item will be a core piece of our work with the ETLC as we continue to adapt our workers to the needs of the tourism industry."

Consequence of the labour intensity in health tourism and relatively high level of skills required interdisciplinary sector between health care and tourism struggles to find employees with the mixed skills. Invest in flexible education tools, to encourage the improvement of personal and responsible healthy lifestyle of all citizens and to be able to change skilled works between tourism and health - depend on the needs. 
Boosting the use of thermal spa and medical tourism as a fast answer to waiting lists within Europe. Europe happens to be the oldest and largest spa market in the world within a health care system as a tradition. Some EU countries face more challenges regarding waiting lists for spa/medical procedures, while others have capacity for more patients. Nevertheless, the use of thermal spas and visit to spa destinations should be promoted within the EU, particularly the post-covid recovery concept that has already proven to render results across Europe. 
Adapting current health care educational systems in Europe with the goal to close workforce gaps. Implementing doctors’ exchange programmes and attracting non-European medical students as tomorrow’s skilled workforce and medical tourism ambassadors should be stimulated. Some EU countries learned that attracting foreign students enhance image in medical tourism and build up succession planning of medical staff. It also reinforces liaisons between the countries and welcomes new global opportunities for medical tourism on global level. Moreover, medical staff is a scarce resource in the European Union while its population is getting older and requiring even more medical attention.

- to establish a cooperation within the Universities with health tourism management, health tourism in general to collaborate and to exchange information and to deliver the result for european cooperation and optimization latest 2025."

In particular, Federturismo Confindustria and the other NTG project partners have actively supported DG GROW not only in the launch phase of the Pact for Skills in the tourism sector, but also in its subsequent implementation phase.
Moreover, what is established at European level in the roundtables and meetings related to the development of the Pact for Skills in the tourism sector is then deployed at national and regional level by the National/Regional Skills Groups set up by the Next Tourism Generation Alliance, also in order to reach more quickly and involve more effectively the stakeholders of such a large and fragmented sector by capitalizing on the previous engagement work of the NTG project team.
Thus, in addition to making all its project outputs available to the various stakeholders, the NTG team is working on the Key Performance Indicators of the Pact for Skills in tourism, carrying out at the same time a Skills Intelligence Action, consisting of an activity of identification and continuous monitoring of the digital, green and social skills that companies most need.
Based on the milestones achieved in close collaboration with DG GROW, Federturismo Confindustria's concrete pledges will be in the coming years:
1) first of all, continue to actively support the National / Regional Skills Groups already established in 7 countries (Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ireland, United Kingdom) as part of the NTG project;
2) secondly, by 2025 - as a member of the partnership ""Pact for Next Tourism Generation Skills"" (acronym PANTOUR, the new Sector Skills Alliance entrusted with the implementation of the Blueprint in the tourism industry for the next 4 years) - to promote the establishment and accompany the activities of new National / Regional Skills Groups in at least 4 additional countries (Finland, Greece, Belgium, Germany)."

339,24,"The new Tourism Act defends the idea that to be sustainable, our economic system need to take into account not only environment concerns: sustainability also aplies to society and economy as a whole.

With this in mind, the law points to correct a situation between one of its most punished collectives. The room service workers in the hospitality sector are the most suffered collective in Hostelry, as they represent the 27% of the accident rate in the whole tourism sector. Additionally, this collective is strongly feminized, with almost no men among them. Most of their injuries are musculoskeletal disorders associated with overexertions. Correcting this situation will represent a measure of social justice for the part of labour, but also for the part of gender equality.

In this context, our Labour Health Institute (IBASSAL) made a study in collaboration with a big hostelry company to evaluate the potential benefit for room service workers of the installation of lifting mechanisms in hostelry's beds. In this study, the entities conclude that this technology has the potential to reduce the effort 8'4 times if the bed is individual and 7'3 times if the bed si for couples.

With this knowledge the Balearic Government introduced the obligation to install lifting mechanisms in the 100% of the beds in the sector. This substitution can be distributed along all the transition period (2022-2027). 

The Government is supporting the sector by financing the purchase of these mechansims with EU NextGen funds.

In order to implement the objective of providing accessible tourism services we commit to the following three actions:
a. by June 2023: revitalise our structure and thereby realising full-fledged accessibility by design. The revitalisation will build on the EU strategy for the rights of persons with disabilities (2021-2030) and aim at showcasing how accessibility and tourism are synergetic twins rather than foes;
b. by July 2023: implement 36 measures aiming at fostering accessibility. These measures will guarantee that not only the structure itself but also bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms etc take the needs of persons with reduced mobility fully into account;
c. by August 2023: turn from hardware to software and publish our access-strategy on our website and promote accessible tourism amongst local actors but also - via online tools - at international level. The ambition is to showcase that fully accessible tourism is possible without having to compromise in design and without the risk of losing attractivity amongst persons who are not dependent on fully accessible destinations."

352,25,"TOURISM FOR ALL; TOURISM WITHOUT OBSTACLES
Current situation: The service Accessible Zagreb is a developmental project aimed at mapping and providing information on the accessibility of surfaces and facilities in the area of the City of Zagreb. The service is available through web pages and as a mobile application, and it provides information about the accessibility of various facilities from public, private and civil sectors. The base currently comprises approximately 2,500 facilities categorised as accessible, inaccessible or partially accessible. There are three levels of accessibility: access to the facility, entrance to the building and interior of the building. Also, each facility contains a photo gallery showing accessibility status, and the service is integrated with Google Maps for easier navigation and travel planning. The application Accessible Zagreb currently contains eight categories (culture, catering, education, sports, administration, services, social welfare and health) and is available in Croatian and in English and German languages.
The service has also developed an accessibility map which, integrated with Google Maps service, shows an accessible pedestrian route for the disabled within a mapped area which currently encompasses the wider centre of the City, while the navigation recognises/avoids the following obstacles or disturbances on sidewalks: stairs, high kerbs, uneven ground surfaces, insufficiently wide sidewalks, excessive side walk slopes. The service is mostly used by the citizens of Zagreb, but it should be made visible to tourists and visitors of the City. 
Measure: Examining the needs which would be additionally interesting to disabled visitors and tourists and those with special needs, translating the Service into other global languages and additional promotion towards eminent markets.
Objective: The goal is to have the service completely adapted to all persons with special needs or to the disabled and to have it available in at least two other global languages by 2024."
353,25,"Our goal is to monitor reliable information that allows people with accessibility needs to understand if the structures of the tourism chain are adequate to their needs by extending the current V4A Network to other countries besides Italy, Croatia and San Marino through the use of V4AInside Software.
V4AInside has been developed based on accessibility studies and analysis of the needs expressed by customers with specific needs and/or disabilities during national and international projects and ""best practices"".
For which tourists does V4AInside collect information? 
The system collects information useful to: people with disabilities (permanent or temporary), motor, sensory limitations (blind and deaf), food allergies and intolerances, the elderly, diabetics, dialysis, obese people and families with small children. 
For which nationalities of tourists is Village for all Inside able to provide information?
The system collects objective information, measurements, data, dimensions, etc... and these are of an objective information and as such are of support to people of any nationality.
Is V4AInside a national accessibility assessment system?
The system does not evaluate accessibility but collects data that allow people to evaluate the facilities according to their abilities/aspirations and for this reason it can be used in any country. It does not evaluate according to the regulations in force in any of the European and non-European countries and the platform is multilingual.
Who can use V4AInside?
The application has been developed to be used by qualified inspectors who have followed a specific training course organized by Village for all®. Does V4AInside guarantee accessibility?
The system allows you to verify the quality of the information collected by the Village for all inspectors. The information collected is used to understand the organisation of the structure, services and spaces, so that each customer, based on their specific needs, disabilities or needs is able to assess whether they meet their request for accessibility.
 For which tourist facilities does V4AInside collect information? Hotels, restaurants, bathing establishments, tourist villages, museums, palaces, monuments, etc... are to date 28 different types of facilities on which this application can be used.
How does V4AInside help improve accessibility?
At the end of the audit, thanks to a specially developed algorithm, a list of interventions and possible improvements (removal of architectural and organizational barriers such as menus for coeliacs, communication such as communication/information systems for the deaf and/or blind, etc.) aimed at improving hospitality for all customers is drawn up.
What accessibility standards does V4AInside suggest?
The reference point for the identification of improvement interventions for the structures reviewed are the ISO 21542:2011 Building construction standard. Accessibility and usability of the built environment, with some improvements compared to the standards.
V4AInside also guarantees: 
•	assurance of the quality of the information 
•	containment of the possibility of error 
•	guarantees the same result regardless of the detector 
•	creation of a recognisable and reliable information standard for the end user and the professional user (TO/adv) 
•	reduction of costs and time taken into account 
•	reduction of the time taken to disseminate the results 
•	final output allows the surveyed structures to increase their accessibility and at the same time to raise awareness of the entrepreneurs involved 
•	pluri-lingual embodiment 
•	allows the execution of multiple contextual audits, e.g. Italian Hospitality Brand - V4A® 
•	the application is easily implementable with other evaluation paths

The most exciting travel content is now usually in the brains of top local guides that are hard to scale and most tourists don’t get guided by a personal guide. SmartGuide allows guides to share their local knowledge in a scalable manner with a much broader audience of independent tourists who would not take a tour. Tour operators can publish their SmartGuides easily and for free or sell them to earn extra revenue and only pay SmartGuide a small share of what they earn. This provides also interesting opportunities to share local knowledge also between residents from different generations and cultural groups.

By 2023 SmartGuide pledges to develop dedicated support for rural regions that require slightly different content architecture than urban destinations where SmartGuide focused until now. New functions will be developed and piloted in Moldova with the national tourism organization and UNDP and then made available to other rural regions in the second half of 2023."

Current situation: The circulation of tourists in the City of Zagreb is mainly taking place in the very centre where they spend on average less than two days. Considering the growing tourist circulation, it is likely that there would be a negative impact on the very centre of the City. For that reason it is necessary to take a positive initiative and redirect tourists towards other City areas, not so much known to the them, but with tourist potential as well. This is how a possible negative impact on the quality of life in the City can be reduced.  
Measure: Mapping the City zones, with their specificities including cultural, sporting, recreational and gastronomy offer, through interviews and workshops with various stakeholders, and creation of a platform primarily aimed at tourists, but also to the citizens of Zagreb.
Objective: The goal is to achieve more balanced and sustainable development of tourism in the City of Zagreb by 2023, resulting in extended stay of tourists, citizens’, visitors’ and tourists’ getting a complete idea of the City, its customs, culture, creation of additional experience, improvement of the citizens’ quality of life and by inclusion of the so far-unknown offer in the tourist map of the City of Zagreb.

The aim for the initiative is that by 2030, the Lofoten islands will be Norway's most climate-friendly, resource-smart and renewable travel destination. The region will showcase Norway’s leading management of sustainable travel destinations. The Destination Lofoten has already committed to and achieved status as a sustainable travel destination from Innovation Norway, which is the Norwegian Government's most important instrument for innovation and development of Norwegian enterprises and industry. 

A concrete target for “Lofoten the Green Islands” is to become a low-emission destination, powered by renewable energy in the near-future, through a Road Map for Lofoten the Green Islands, an action plan, setting out concrete targets and actions within six target areas.  

The Road Map includes: 

Lofoten aims to become a low-emission society by 2040 and work effectively to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.  

60 percent of tourism businesses in the region will have their own climate accounting by the end of 2023, as well as a climate budget by 2024.  

Greenhouse gases from the tourism industry in Lofoten Islands will be reduced by 60 percent by 2030.  

By 2030, Lofoten Islands will strengthen its position as a world leading tourist destination by delivering sustainable adventures in nature, culture, food and good cooperation with the local community 

The tourism industry will prioritize the transition to a circular economy, including through the utilization of local resources.  

Tourists travelling to and in Lofoten will use public transport and/or emission-free transport options. In the region, we work strategically to offer a commercial zero-emission route, to Lofoten.
