0,1,"HOTREC calls for a level playing field and fair competition in the EU for the hospitality sector. We advocate for a specific instrument that addresses the complex and diverse regulatory questions presented by the STR industry. The main objectives include the introduction of a robust and efficient EU-wide registration system; or outlining clear and comprehensive data-sharing requirements. HOTREC made its first call for a level playing field for hoteliers vis-à-vis STR in 2014 and has since then produced several brochures and policy papers addressing how to introduce rules which are adapted to STR services and necessary regulatory requirements. _x000D_
_x000D_
We commit to issue and disseminate during the course of 2022 our position and research study among the EU institutions as well as with members of HOTREC and other stakeholders via our website. We will continue to share our position on the matter including via meetings with interested parties and stakeholders in order to reach a fair framework on the topic. Through our internal working group on STR held twice a year as well as during our biannual General Assemblies, we’ll continue to gather information about STR developments in EU countries and share the latter with the EU stakeholders during the designing phase of the STR regulation. We intend to continue monitoring STR developments during the implementation phase of the STR initiative and act as an information sharing platform between our members"

La Région entend élargir très fortement l’accessibilité en transports en commun de l’offre touristique régionale. _x000D_
En effet, les destinations et sites touristiques ne sont pas toujours facilement accessibles depuis les gares régionales. Il est donc nécessaire de développer une offre de mobilité répondant aux besoins de tous les visiteurs et reliant les gares et les principaux monuments ou lieux touristiques. Le développement des grands projets de transports, et en particulier du réseau circulaire du Grand Paris Express, permettra dans les années à venir d’améliorer l’accessibilité de nombreux territoires et sites touristiques. Cependant, la Région veillera également à ce que cette dimension touristique soit bien prise en compte non seulement dans le cadre du projet du Grand Paris, mais aussi par l’autorité régionale d’organisation des mobilités, Île-de-France Mobilités, et les opérateurs de transports en commun._x000D_
Si les mobilités douces sont une partie de la solution, la Région souhaite accompagner également l’innovation dans les territoires. C’est pourquoi, un appel à projets “Dernier kilomètre” sera proposé aux territoires (Départements ou Intercommunalités, Parcs naturels régionaux) qui seraient intéressés par la démarche. L’objectif est de trouver des solutions viables adaptées à la fréquentation touristique de lieux éloignés du réseau ferré régional, en faisant appel à des solutions innovantes. La Région interviendra notamment en matière d’investissements._x000D_
Par ailleurs, la Région Île-de-France et le Comité Régional du Tourisme Paris Île-de-France (CRT), en lien avec les partenaires de l’offre touristique, entendent travailler à renforcer les services offerts par les opérateurs de transport en faveur de l’utilisation par les touristes des transports en commun pour se déplacer dans l’ensemble de la destination. _x000D_
Cette volonté forte de faciliter l’accès au site dans une approche multimodale sur l’ensemble du territoire régional sera systématiquement mise en valeur dans les campagnes de communication menées à destination des clientèles de proximité, nationale ou internationales.ù"

This project is producing an info hub and will deliver a road map describing the next steps to create the NSTO by the end of 2022. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our organization, including some of our member regions (e.g. in Italy and Spain) in particular are especially engaged in this process and will keep working after the project’s conclusion to set up this Network of observatories with the idea to bring together the main parties to share ideas, techniques and tools on data/indicators, and to build multi-level cooperation in order to seek better joint solutions and work in a common direction. _x000D_
_x000D_
Hopefully for 2025 we will have consolidated the current embryo of network of observatories, linking up with INSTO from UN WTO, the Glasgow Declaration and other initiatives/EC actions, indeed contributing to the EU Pathway and topic 3 and in particular to harmonised data collection, improving access to data for official statistics and including key sustainability indicators on the basis of the work already done in the past and in concrete projects such as BEST MED, Mitomed +, Co-Evolve, among others. _x000D_

Current situation: Currently, there is no system for measuring the sustainability of tourism development. Several institutions (City of Zagreb, City of Zagreb Tourist Board, Croatian Bureau of Statistics etc.) measure mainly statistical data on the territory of the City of Zagreb, in order to monitor the arrivals, overnight stays, number of visitors and similar. So far, these institutions have not monitored tourism by taking into account sustainability. The setting up of a uniform system for monitoring the sustainable development of tourism, such as a digital platform putting together all reports on a yearly basis, would allow the monitoring of tourism industry sustainability and that would ensure timely detection and minimisation of possible negative impacts, which may be caused by tourist operations at the destination. The indicators of sustainable development of tourism have multiple functions, including the examination of past changes and the prediction of the future ones, which contributes to better understanding of complex processes at the destination. Correctly determined sustainable development indicators will lead to quality and informed management and more efficient measuring, and will as well represent a better basis for taking decisions concerning sustainable tourism development and better management of urban resources._x000D_

Current situation: The Development Strategy of the City of Zagreb, as the City's main strategic development document, which includes tourism to a minor extent, became insufficient for further growth and development of sustainable tourism in the City of Zagreb. Also, there is no clearly defined direction of further development of tourism, based on sustainability principles. Since tourism, in its scope, closely interacts and depends on other sectors, such as transport, agriculture, health, digitalisation, landscaping and others, it is necessary to prepare a strategy aligned with sustainable policies for the other sectors and representing a starting point for embracing and further development of the issues and measures touching upon tourism sector in the preparation of their plans.  _x000D_

By defining specific advantages and resolving specific challenges of the destination, tourist potential of the available area will be considered, as well as its basis, in terms of resources and attractions. Possible infrastructural, demographic, institutional and similar development limitations will be analysed, especially taking into account the principles of sustainable development, the developmental needs and potential of tourism.

1.	By transforming the “Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit” principles into policy measures and projects. NECSTouR signed the Barcelona Declaration in April 2018.  Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit which aims at balancing the uses of cultural heritage and other territorial assets by the residents, the visitors, and the tourism businesses. It proposes five key principles addressing aspects related to governance, sense of belonging, promotion, measurability, and interpersonal relations to be endorsed by tourism as well as the cultural and other related stakeholders. It shows the consensus of key stakeholders committed to demonstrate what tourism and cultural heritage sectors can achieve by working more closely together, for the benefit of European citizens and cultural heritage as well as businesses, visitors, and destinations, in line with the SDGs. This is why NECSTouR Regions keeps identifying examples of turning principles into policy measures and projects. First, through an event in Barcelona in September 2022, aiming at generating exchanges, reflections, and debates on how the wellbeing of the local community and the climate actions needs are driving the transformation of the tourism model and ecosystem, moving from sustainable to responsible and regenerative tourism. The event will reflect the legacy of the Barcelona declaration “Better places to Live, Better Places to Visit” in NECSTouR members’ strategies, actions, and initiatives. Equally important is the development of interregional pilot projects to build methodologies and test them on the ground. This will be possible if European funding is obtained."

Post lock-down, many local communities felt unprepared to deal with the large increase in visitors, particularly day visitors, campers and campervans. To address some of the negative impacts on communities, VisitScotland led a successful, large-scale collaboration aimed at engaging stakeholders and visitors on responsible enjoyment. _x000D_
_x000D_
Launched in March 2021 with a Responsible Tourism Visitor Pledge, the partnership includes National Park Authorities, Police Scotland, nature, land and transport bodies, as well as local authorities, to provide a robust and practical strategy with short, medium and long-term actions and benefits. _x000D_
_x000D_
Leading a collaborative, cross-organisation approach to marketing and communication, a fully realised campaign has now been delivered to provide information, guidance and education around outdoor access, camping, fire & water safety, motorhomes & campervans, littering & waste.

For what concerns sustainable mobility, we will explore opportunities to build projects that allow to test solutions based on behavioural science to influence more responsible behaviours when it comes to tourism mobility._x000D_
By 2025/2030, we expect to have produced and tested behavioural science-based solutions related, among other topics, to sustainable tourism mobility. These solutions will be brought to the attention of policy makers at different levels, for their scale-up and adoption in public policies. We will also disseminate them to mobility practitioners for their replication._x000D_
> What is behavioural science and why is it relevant?_x000D_
""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) _x000D_
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential._x000D_
For example, in the sector of mobility we could test solutions that, after the observation of behaviours, use the related congitive biases to orient the choice of sustainable mobility options, for example by making these the default options."

The use of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) is key to decarbonise the industry in the short to medium term.  SAF can deliver significant CO2 emissions savings and is a promising technology to pursue the achievement of the EU Green Deal’s objectives.  For these reasons, Ryanair committed to an industry-leading 12.5% SAF use in 2030.  In April 2022, we announced a partnership with Neste, a SAF supplier, to power approx. one third of our flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend.  This SAF will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%, supporting Ryanair’s Pathway to Net Zero by 2050 decarbonisation goals.  Ryanair has already significantly advanced this commitment by partnering with Trinity College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, which was launched in April 2021.

1.Cyclo-tourism and cycling infrastructure_x000D_
Current situation: In the City of Zagreb there are currently 237,709 m of cycle lanes and sidewalks, while the share of cycle traffic in the overall city traffic is 3%. There are also 54,140 m of roads where shared traffic has been introduced. The existing cycling infrastructure of the City of Zagreb is not adequate (traffic continuity is not adequately managed, kerbs are still undropped, signals are irregularly installed), for which reason there is need for continuous investment, education and promotion of everyday bicycle use. To reach that objective, Zagreb is currently adopting an operation plan for the development of cycling traffic and an activity plan concerning the education and promotion of everyday bicycle use for moving within the city. _x000D_
Measure – In the coming period measures and activities will be implemented in order to increase pedestrian and cycling traffic, public transport share, and reduce the share of motor vehicle traffic. Another 3,000 m of cycle lanes will be constructed, especially those separated from pedestrian sidewalks and motor vehicle transport; other forms of shared transport, such as bike sharing and car sharing, will be stimulated as well._x000D_
Objective – Long-term objectives include the building of complete cycling infrastructure in the area of the City of Zagreb in order to allow quality and safe movement of cyclists. One of strategic objectives in the future development of urban and suburban traffic on the territory of the City of Zagreb and its wider area significantly relates to sustainable development stimulation through the introduction of cycling traffic in the traffic system. The other objectives, inter alia, include: an 8% increase of the cycling traffic share in the city traffic, growth of cycling surfaces due to the introduction of shared traffic on the pavement and 30 km/h zones in the wider area of the City._x000D_
2.Widening of the car-free zones in the very centre of the City_x000D_
Current situation: The area of the centre of the City of Zagreb extends on a surface of approximately 6.5 km2, while 81,669.92 m of streets are without car traffic. Examples of good practice have shown that the elimination of road traffic and the widening of pedestrian zones increase air quality, reduce traffic jams and noise levels, revive city centres, which, at the end of the day, contributes to the quality of life of all citizens, especially those who live in the City centre. The plan to extend car-free zones would stimulate citizens to a more frequent use of healthier means of transport, such as public transport and bicycles.  _x000D_
Measures: Gradual extension of car-free zones in the very centre of the city, by transforming the existing streets open to vehicle traffic into car-free streets._x000D_

86,7,"AViTeM will contribute to this topic by enhancing its ongoing cooperation work through EU territorial cooperation projects with other organisations, local/regional/national institutions, associations, businesses across Europe and the Mediterranean. For what concerns circularity in the hospitality industry, we will keep exploring opportunities to build projects that allow to test solutions based on behavioural science to enhance a smarter use of resources and a more responsible behaviour of hosts._x000D_
By 2025/2030, we expect to have produced and tested behavioural science-based solutions related, among other topics, to circularity in the hospitality industry. These solutions will be brought to the attention of policy makers at different levels, for their scale-up and adoption in public policies. They will also be disseminated to hospitality practitioners who may be interested to replicate them._x000D_
> What is behavioural science and why is it relevant?_x000D_
""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) _x000D_
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential. _x000D_
For example, in the hospitality industry there can be room to test solutions based on behavioural science to reduce food waste or plastic use, or optimise the use of water and energy."

Green Transition of tourism SMEs:_x000D_
We are committed to making it easier for travellers to book more sustainable trips. Supporting tourism accommodations in developing their sustainability programmes, while recognising those who have already made significant efforts to improve the sustainability of their operations. By showcasing these efforts on our platform (increasing the supply of more sustainable travel options), we aim to make it easy for travellers to book more sustainable travel. Today only a small number of  tourism accommodations have invested in existing sustainability certifications._x000D_
 _x000D_
We have launched the  Travel Sustainable Programme that has 2 central components: _x000D_
1) Educating and raising awareness amongst tourism accommodations on their impact in the environment they operate in. Initially 32 sustainability practices have been independently validated as impactful. We have been working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Travalyst, Sustainalize and other sustainability experts to share what properties can do to make positive change in the industry. Through the Booking.com Sustainability Handbook, available in 30 languages, Booking.com supports partners to understand which practices may make more sense to them, what impact they will have; sharing tips and best practices. The objective is to get accommodations started on sustainability._x000D_
2) A  badge and filter on our product. The badge is awarded automatically to accommodations who already have one of 37 3rd party certifications we accept as part of our framework. For those properties that have implemented sustainability programmes or adopted sustainability practices but cannot afford or commit to the requirements of a 3rd party certification, our programme will award a badge if they reach a sustainability impact threshold, assigned per continent and independently validated as part of our framework.  Travel Sustainable is an evolving programme, designed to make sure that no accommodation however small, is left behind in the sustainability transition. It will continue to evolve to drive forward the sustainability agenda._x000D_
We believe the badge will provide credible recognition of impactful sustainability efforts for more properties worldwide and provide travelers with a transparent, consistent and easy-to-understand way to identify a wider range of more sustainable stays._x000D_

With our programme we will make sustainability more appealing and accessible to even the smallest accommodations by:_x000D_
A free, large-scale, trusted and easy to understand sustainability label which matches traveller intent (see page 5 of our most recent Sustainable Travel Report) while reducing some key barriers for sustainability adoption for SME tourism accommodation providers (such as investment, information gaps or time to implement), increasing the likelihood that more accommodations can and will enhance their sustainability offering.  _x000D_
Tailoring the sustainability journey and support provided to reflect the more limited resources and investment often available to SME accommodations._x000D_
Providing alternative approaches to assessing the sustainability of an accommodation e.g verified through a combination of innovative tools including customer reviews, on-site checks and AI, and thereby breaking down the cost barrier to certification._x000D_

Until today, we digitised 100+ cultural objects, have set up modern digital cultural centres and developed other innovative tools for exploring the heritage (e.g. mobile phone games). The developed content was used for the creation of 30+ unique Slovenian tourist experiences with high-added value. _x000D_
In Nova Gorica we have already established a Huture centre with the vision to become the competence centre for heritage in CEE. _x000D_
_x000D_
DICH was also presented as one of the Slovenian flagship cultural projects in the Slovenian pavilion at EXPO2020 in Dubai (https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=_hPFhKiyYMU). Moreover, Slovenia has invested in developing the national Portal of DICH (https://www.dikd.si/en/) where all 118 Slovenian 3D models are available. The content is also available in Europeana. _x000D_

_x000D_
Climate change is changing our world, making it one of the biggest threats of the 21st century. A first decisive step towards more climate-friendly travel is transparency: Emissions are calculated uniformly and presented for employees and customers, so that more climate-friendly travel could be offered and booked in the future. _x000D_
_x000D_
DER Touristik has therefore led the Centre for Sustainable Tourism together with Futouris (ZENAT) mandates to compile a market overview of the existing climate accounting systems. The overview showed that there are already good calculation bases for emissions from air traffic and methods that also determine the climate impact of other travel components. However, there is no climate accounting standard covering all elements of the tourism value chain and at the same time that would be accepted from as many partners as possible as an industry standard._x000D_
_x000D_
That’s why DER Touristik is now actively involved in Futouris’ industry project “Klimabewusst reisen”. By the end of October 2022, Futouris members develop in cooperation with the Institut for Sustainable Development Tourismus GmbH and the German Travel Association DRV a standard for climate accounting of Travel to find industry-wide support. _x000D_

We do so by measuring environmental impacts and developing mitigating policies and strategies, including assessing the societal and economic implications. The results are not only sound reports and articles but also innovative research approaches and tools based on a solid translation of science to the sector practices. _x000D_
_x000D_
To this end, we: _x000D_
1.	Measure and forecast the effects of tourism and tourism transport on the environment – particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – and possible consequences for consumers and businesses under current and alternative policy regimes. _x000D_
2.	Examine and influence processes of policy formation to guide policy actors in the development of alternative policies that effectively address specific tourism-related environmental challenges – particularly climate change. _x000D_
3.	Explore innovative approaches, measures, ideas, and new applications._x000D_
4.	Develop innovative tools – including serious gaming applications and enlightening translations of scientific outcomes for both policy-makers, the public, and business leaders – to assist policy-making._x000D_
_x000D_
To create impact with our research, we aim for scientific integrity, quality, credibility, societal relevance, and consistency. Staying true to science is central to our approach. We only engage in consultancy and research projects when there is a direct link to our own research track record or knowledge of the scientific state-of-the-art. And we aim for solid, pro-active science communication and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders across the political spectrum. _x000D_
We do so by:_x000D_
1	Pursuing relevant research and consultancy projects in the tourism and environmental policy domain, with a focus on tourism-related transport issues. _x000D_
2	Integrate the findings in reports and outputs that are immediately relevant for stakeholders in this domain because they provide science-based directions to ongoing policy debates. _x000D_
3	Publishing the findings of our research in reputable, international peer-reviewed academic publications. _x000D_
4	Present and discuss our findings and hypotheses at international scientific and applied conferences and workshops. _x000D_
5	Engage with policymakers and the general public through mainstream media and other (social) media channels to address key societal challenges based on our research. _x000D_

La Stratégie régionale d’économie circulaire prévoit de renforcer l’engagement de la filière touristique en faveur de l’économie circulaire, pour en limiter l’impact environnemental. Ce choix, très engageant pour la filière, implique un accompagnement très fort de la part de la Région et de ses partenaires car il s’agit de ne pas se limiter à quelques grands acteurs du tourisme mais bien de chercher à apporter des réponses concrètes aux besoins vitaux, matériels et en termes de service des environ 50 millions de visiteurs français et internationaux, que l’Ile-de-France, destination d’envergure mondiale, accueille chaque année._x000D_
Ce travail autour de l’engagement vers une véritable économie circulaire touristique nécessitera, au-delà de questionnements et de travaux sur les enjeux environnementaux, un renforcement très fort de la mise en réseau des partenaires. La Région, grâce notamment à ses organismes associés (CRT, IDF Terre de Saveurs, Institut Paris Region), entend se mobiliser sur cet enjeu en s’appuyant sur le levier des fonds européens, et en fléchant notamment 25,3 millions d’euros du FEDER régional pour faciliter la transition des acteurs qui le souhaitent. Tel que prévu dans la Stratégie régionale en faveur de l'économie circulaire (SREC), cette mobilisation régionale pourra aussi se traduire par un cadre d’engagement « tourisme circulaire » signé entre la Région et les acteurs franciliens du tourisme.

The Community gathers 22 projects co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) dealing with sustainable tourism in coastal destinations tackling the priority “environmental protection”. This means that the Community is a source of tested project outcomes dealing with tourism product diversification, addressing negative impacts into the landscape and society, tools and methodologies to better manage and measure tourism. As part of the Climate Action Plan implementation our work will be to analyse which of those examples can fit our (renewed) knowledge hub to guide destinations into the greening transitions. For this at least one more workshop will take place before the ned of 2022. NECSTouR being the partner in charge of the capitalisation activities and the “EU” antenna, transfers the Community’s outcomes to our knowledge hub and mainstreams policy recommendations into the European agenda.

Current situation: By participation in the European Union’s mission named 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 (Mission for cities), the City of Zagreb plans to implement the activities under three priorities which encompass all phases of enhancement of single components contained in the measures. By increasing energy efficiency (“energy efficiency first”), by strongly stimulating the development and use of renewable energy sources, whose current share in energy balance of the City of Zagreb is almost insignificant, and by digitalisation of energy infrastructure (smart networks and remote reading of energy and water consumption), a systematic and synergistic transformation of the whole system will be ensured, as foreseen by the European Green Deal guidelines._x000D_
Stimulation of the introduction of zero-emission vehicles and the accompanying infrastructure will resolve one of the biggest problems in the area of the City of Zagreb, i.e. the continuously growing, negative, impact of emission gases from the traffic sector. Finally, considering the growing negative impact of climate changes, a series of activities concerning the adaptation to climate changes and local negative weather extremes has been defined in order to increase the resilience of the overall critical infrastructure and enhance the readiness of civil protection system. Urban planning, i.e. the processes of landscape planning in the City of Zagreb (PPGZ (Spatial Plan of the City of Zagreb), GUP (General Urban Development Plan), UPUs (Urban Landscaping Plans) etc.) are a very important legislative lever of the City, which has to be used by introducing energy and climate policies in those landscape planning documents in order to stimulate the green transition processes. _x000D_
Measure: Drafting documents which will define the activities, measures and projects by systematically and comprehensively identifying the needs of each single part of the infrastructure which impact the energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other detrimental compound emissions. _x000D_
Objective: Setting up and implementing the measures, activities and projects which will save energy, improve air quality and finally enhance the quality of life."

So, the NTG project partnership – involving 7 trade associations, 6 universities and 1 organization, representing 8 European countries – is engaged to build and implement a structural and permanent mechanism to bridge (and minimize) current and future skills shortages, establishing a Blueprint Strategy for Sectoral Skills Development to respond to the fast changing and increasing gaps in digital, green and social skills sets, also in light of the profound transformation that occurred in the tourism industry following the sudden and disrupting appearance on the scene of the Covid-19 pandemic._x000D_
In order to ensure that the results of the project can be effectively relevant and useful for the next generation of educators, decision makers, investors, companies, institutions, students and workers in the field of tourism and hospitality, the sectoral skills are analysed and developed with the year 2030 as a landmark on the horizon._x000D_

SmartGuide pledges to digital travel content that combines geolocation and navigation with exciting local content in one product optimized to use on the go._x000D_
To grow the supply of such content offerings, SmartGuide pledges to offer its Content Management System (CMS) to content creators self-service for free to publish digital guides as long as they meet the content quality requirements.  The CMS makes content creation fast and easy with smart functions, such as the import of readily available open data (OSM, Wikipedia) automated route generation, built-in DeepL translations, and natural text-to-speech audio being recorded as you type. The CMS allows anyone to publish a professional travel guide as easy as uploading a video on YouTube. _x000D_
Unlike traditional guides (such as Lonely Planet), SmartGuide pledges to leverage the whole community to create guides that cater to tourists and locals with different interests.

Most destinations or SMEs don’t have nearly such budgets. They often get public funding to reinvent the wheel and develop something for €100k-€500 that does not work well.

Based on previous work done in the Next Tourism Generation project (https://nexttourismgeneration.eu), Breda University of Applied Sciences provided a research methodology to assess current skills gaps and future skills needs. The Skills Assessment Methodology (SAM) is a tool that has been designed to identify current and future workforce skills at a national or regional level. As a key element of the Blueprint Strategy, the NTG Skills Assessment Methodology was developed as a research-based, structural mechanism for the analysis of rapidly changing skills and skills needs to develop strategies for addressing skills gaps in the EU Tourism Sector. The focus of the SAM are the skillsets necessary for the future of the workforce, specifically: digital, green and social skills._x000D_
_x000D_
The benefit of the SAM is that it can be used at multiple levels: regional, national or international, adding flexibility and improving feasibility. Although it was developed for assessing digital, green and social skills needs in five tourism subsectors, it can be easily expanded and used to address skills needs in other tourism ecosystems._x000D_
_x000D_
The SAM has been used in eight European countries to create a skills profile of the tourism sector and to formulate a response strategy. This resulted in the production of eight skills reports on current skills gaps and future skills needs. The SAM will be rolled out in at least five other European countries in the coming four years. _x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, new Skills Assessment activities will be carried out throughout the PANTOUR project where Breda University of Applied Sciences leads the research approach on Skills Intelligence. The goal is to ensure a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that feed into sector-wide curricula, integrating work-based learning in the tourism ecosystem and addressing urgent skills needs._x000D_
_x000D_
The sustainability of the PANTOUR project is partly based on developing a European Quality Framework that partner countries and other EU members can use to standardise cross-institute recognition of relevant modules and training content. _x000D_
_x000D_
Breda University of Applied Sciences develops and shares knowledge on current skills gaps and future skills needs, with an objective to develop a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that SMEs, educational institutions and other training providers can use to develop tourism-related curricula and practical courses to meet the most urgent needs. This Skills Intelligence Mechanism would be available for tourism training providers (as open access) by the year 2023."

About Lofoten Islands  _x000D_
_x000D_
The Lofoten islands in North Norway is one of the world’s most attractive tourist destinations. This region of islands is an archipelago with alpine landscape that stretches out from the North Norwegian coastline and inhabits less than 25.000 people working mainly in seafood, tourism and public sector. Lofoten is an attractive place to live, and our business sector is both sustainable and viable. This partnership shall be courageous in a national and international context in the willingness and ability to co-create and promote green and sustainable growth in tourism. Lofoten as a tourist destination will become a preferred testing area and pioneer in piloting low-emission, renewable and regenerative solutions within the tourism industry."
