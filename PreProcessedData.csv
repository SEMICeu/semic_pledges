24,3,"SETTING UP A UNIFORM SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF TOURISM_x000D_
Current situation: Currently, there is no system for measuring the sustainability of tourism development. Several institutions (City of Zagreb, City of Zagreb Tourist Board, Croatian Bureau of Statistics etc.) measure mainly statistical data on the territory of the City of Zagreb, in order to monitor the arrivals, overnight stays, number of visitors and similar. So far, these institutions have not monitored tourism by taking into account sustainability. The setting up of a uniform system for monitoring the sustainable development of tourism, such as a digital platform putting together all reports on a yearly basis, would allow the monitoring of tourism industry sustainability and that would ensure timely detection and minimisation of possible negative impacts, which may be caused by tourist operations at the destination. The indicators of sustainable development of tourism have multiple functions, including the examination of past changes and the prediction of the future ones, which contributes to better understanding of complex processes at the destination. Correctly determined sustainable development indicators will lead to quality and informed management and more efficient measuring, and will as well represent a better basis for taking decisions concerning sustainable tourism development and better management of urban resources._x000D_

49,4,"DRAFTING A TOURISM DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY_x000D_
Current situation: The Development Strategy of the City of Zagreb, as the City's main strategic development document, which includes tourism to a minor extent, became insufficient for further growth and development of sustainable tourism in the City of Zagreb. Also, there is no clearly defined direction of further development of tourism, based on sustainability principles. Since tourism, in its scope, closely interacts and depends on other sectors, such as transport, agriculture, health, digitalisation, landscaping and others, it is necessary to prepare a strategy aligned with sustainable policies for the other sectors and representing a starting point for embracing and further development of the issues and measures touching upon tourism sector in the preparation of their plans.  _x000D_
So far, the development of tourism was mainly based on the exploitation of the existing tourist basis, without strategic investments in the area of tourism. For that reason, the Strategy will also analyse those city resources that can represent an axis of further development of sustainable tourism, such as city assets, city infrastructure, transport, architecture, cultural heritage, local population etc., together with the plan aimed at resolving the problems defined in the programme.  By defining specific advantages and resolving specific challenges of the destination, tourist potential of the available area will be considered, as well as its basis, in terms of resources and attractions. Possible infrastructural, demographic, institutional and similar development limitations will be analysed, especially taking into account the principles of sustainable development, the developmental needs and potential of tourism. The City of Zagreb wants to enable further development of sustainable tourism in its area, based on the sustainable use of urban resources, by respecting and establishing a balance between tourism and the City or its citizens._x000D_

Better Places to Live, Better Places to Visit which aims at balancing the uses of cultural heritage and other territorial assets by the residents, the visitors, and the tourism businesses. It proposes five key principles addressing aspects related to governance, sense of belonging, promotion, measurability, and interpersonal relations to be endorsed by tourism as well as the cultural and other related stakeholders. It shows the consensus of key stakeholders committed to demonstrate what tourism and cultural heritage sectors can achieve by working more closely together, for the benefit of European citizens and cultural heritage as well as businesses, visitors, and destinations, in line with the SDGs. This is why NECSTouR Regions keeps identifying examples of turning principles into policy measures and projects. First, through an event in Barcelona in September 2022, aiming at generating exchanges, reflections, and debates on how the wellbeing of the local community and the climate actions needs are driving the transformation of the tourism model and ecosystem, moving from sustainable to responsible and regenerative tourism.

""Behavioural Science is the systematic study of human behaviour and the design of strategies to intentionally and verifiably change it, leveraging psychological insights and experimental methods from a variety of disciplines, including behavioural economics, psychology, decision science, sociology and neuroscience. In short, it is the science of what we do, why we do it and how we can change it."" (Source: Applied Behavioural Science Academy) _x000D_
Much of what we do to make tourism policies and practices more sustainable depends of human behaviour (visitors flows, seasonality, littering, choice of less sustainable travel options...). The knowledge of the human brain, its functioning and what's behind human behaviours can therefore make a huge difference when we want to encourage a particular behaviour and enhance the sustainability of our tourism services. That's why the application of behavioural science to tourism sustainability has a great potential._x000D_

The use of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) is key to decarbonise the industry in the short to medium term.  SAF can deliver significant CO2 emissions savings and is a promising technology to pursue the achievement of the EU Green Deal’s objectives.  For these reasons, Ryanair committed to an industry-leading 12.5% SAF use in 2030.  In April 2022, we announced a partnership with Neste, a SAF supplier, to power approx. one third of our flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend.  This SAF will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 60%, supporting Ryanair’s Pathway to Net Zero by 2050 decarbonisation goals.  Ryanair has already significantly advanced this commitment by partnering with Trinity College Dublin to open the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, which was launched in April 2021.  It is composed by 11 engineers and scientists focused on researching SAF, zero carbon aircraft propulsion systems and noise mapping for low-noise aircraft fleets._x000D_

1.Cyclo-tourism and cycling infrastructure_x000D_
Current situation: In the City of Zagreb there are currently 237,709 m of cycle lanes and sidewalks, while the share of cycle traffic in the overall city traffic is 3%. There are also 54,140 m of roads where shared traffic has been introduced. The existing cycling infrastructure of the City of Zagreb is not adequate (traffic continuity is not adequately managed, kerbs are still undropped, signals are irregularly installed), for which reason there is need for continuous investment, education and promotion of everyday bicycle use. To reach that objective, Zagreb is currently adopting an operation plan for the development of cycling traffic and an activity plan concerning the education and promotion of everyday bicycle use for moving within the city. _x000D_
Measure – In the coming period measures and activities will be implemented in order to increase pedestrian and cycling traffic, public transport share, and reduce the share of motor vehicle traffic. Another 3,000 m of cycle lanes will be constructed, especially those separated from pedestrian sidewalks and motor vehicle transport; other forms of shared transport, such as bike sharing and car sharing, will be stimulated as well._x000D_
Objective – Long-term objectives include the building of complete cycling infrastructure in the area of the City of Zagreb in order to allow quality and safe movement of cyclists. One of strategic objectives in the future development of urban and suburban traffic on the territory of the City of Zagreb and its wider area significantly relates to sustainable development stimulation through the introduction of cycling traffic in the traffic system. The other objectives, inter alia, include: an 8% increase of the cycling traffic share in the city traffic, growth of cycling surfaces due to the introduction of shared traffic on the pavement and 30 km/h zones in the wider area of the City._x000D_
2.Widening of the car-free zones in the very centre of the City_x000D_
Current situation: The area of the centre of the City of Zagreb extends on a surface of approximately 6.5 km2, while 81,669.92 m of streets are without car traffic. Examples of good practice have shown that the elimination of road traffic and the widening of pedestrian zones increase air quality, reduce traffic jams and noise levels, revive city centres, which, at the end of the day, contributes to the quality of life of all citizens, especially those who live in the City centre. The plan to extend car-free zones would stimulate citizens to a more frequent use of healthier means of transport, such as public transport and bicycles.  _x000D_
Measures: Gradual extension of car-free zones in the very centre of the city, by transforming the existing streets open to vehicle traffic into car-free streets._x000D_

Current situation: Projects and solutions aimed at resolving various citizens’ problems function as isolated points without being interconnected, such that it is not rare that they duplicate or that their full potential is not used; their data are not consolidated or integrated into a single system, which makes it difficult to citizens, and the overall public sector, to navigate in a large amount of information. A recently launched digital infrastructure sector project is the platform Zagreb Smart City Hub, which represents a simple tool for citizens which allows them to find relevant information about “smart” projects in the City area. The platform gives citizens an additional opportunity to communicate about key decisions and get involved in the strategic decision-making, while various information is gathered in a single point. _x000D_

Green Transition of tourism SMEs:_x000D_
We are committed to making it easier for travellers to book more sustainable trips. Supporting tourism accommodations in developing their sustainability programmes, while recognising those who have already made significant efforts to improve the sustainability of their operations. By showcasing these efforts on our platform (increasing the supply of more sustainable travel options), we aim to make it easy for travellers to book more sustainable travel. Today only a small number of  tourism accommodations have invested in existing sustainability certifications._x000D_
 _x000D_
We have launched the  Travel Sustainable Programme that has 2 central components: _x000D_
1) Educating and raising awareness amongst tourism accommodations on their impact in the environment they operate in. Initially 32 sustainability practices have been independently validated as impactful. We have been working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Travalyst, Sustainalize and other sustainability experts to share what properties can do to make positive change in the industry. Through the Booking.com Sustainability Handbook, available in 30 languages, Booking.com supports partners to understand which practices may make more sense to them, what impact they will have; sharing tips and best practices. The objective is to get accommodations started on sustainability._x000D_
2) A  badge and filter on our product. The badge is awarded automatically to accommodations who already have one of 37 3rd party certifications we accept as part of our framework. For those properties that have implemented sustainability programmes or adopted sustainability practices but cannot afford or commit to the requirements of a 3rd party certification, our programme will award a badge if they reach a sustainability impact threshold, assigned per continent and independently validated as part of our framework.  Travel Sustainable is an evolving programme, designed to make sure that no accommodation however small, is left behind in the sustainability transition. It will continue to evolve to drive forward the sustainability agenda._x000D_
We believe the badge will provide credible recognition of impactful sustainability efforts for more properties worldwide and provide travelers with a transparent, consistent and easy-to-understand way to identify a wider range of more sustainable stays._x000D_
 _x000D_
With our programme we will make sustainability more appealing and accessible to even the smallest accommodations by:_x000D_
A free, large-scale, trusted and easy to understand sustainability label which matches traveller intent (see page 5 of our most recent Sustainable Travel Report) while reducing some key barriers for sustainability adoption for SME tourism accommodation providers (such as investment, information gaps or time to implement), increasing the likelihood that more accommodations can and will enhance their sustainability offering.  _x000D_
Tailoring the sustainability journey and support provided to reflect the more limited resources and investment often available to SME accommodations._x000D_
Providing alternative approaches to assessing the sustainability of an accommodation e.g verified through a combination of innovative tools including customer reviews, on-site checks and AI, and thereby breaking down the cost barrier to certification._x000D_

Going forward, we will continue to expand our existing Travel Sustainable Handbook and sustainability education programs for accommodations to tailor support based on their maturity level and local context._x000D_

Flows is an innovative solution for data-driven local destination management to monitor carrying capacity and well-being. FLOWS enable GDPR-compliant advanced analyses and forecasts of tourist movements based on anonymised data from a multitude of different sources (traffic counters, data from mobile operators, freely accessible Wi-Fi networks, tourist tax, etc.). A simple user interface will display traffic flows: excessive traffic loads, seasonal deviations, entrances/exits to the destination, movement within the destination, etc. It displays the analyses in the selected time interval (year, month, week, day), forecasts based on historical data, weighted by special parameters (weekend, weather, national or holiday in other countries, etc.). FLOWS analysis enables us to predict the tourist flows and make the right decision for supporting the development of balanced and geographically distributed sustainable tourism. With FLOWS, we can influence the tourist flows and their behaviour. Flows technology and knowledge were already used in the T4.0 Alpine Flows project by setting up a footfall monitoring system for the visit to hiking trails. The system will collect up-to-date data on visits to support the sustainable rerouting of Alpine flows. _x000D_

Overtourism is in the long-term damaging the actual sites, which can be avoided by offering a 3D experience to the tourists. This way the heritage is preserved. Also, digital innovating enables green and digital transformation in the cultural sector. _x000D_
Tourism 4.0 became one of the leading experts in Europe in the field of Digital Innovation of Cultural Heritage. Until today, we digitised 100+ cultural objects, have set up modern digital cultural centres and developed other innovative tools for exploring the heritage (e.g. mobile phone games).

In Nova Gorica we have already established a Huture centre with the vision to become the competence centre for heritage in CEE. _x000D_
_x000D_
DICH was also presented as one of the Slovenian flagship cultural projects in the Slovenian pavilion at EXPO2020 in Dubai (https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=_hPFhKiyYMU). Moreover, Slovenia has invested in developing the national Portal of DICH (https://www.dikd.si/en/) where all 118 Slovenian 3D models are available. The content is also available in Europeana. _x000D_

_x000D_
Therefore, DER Touristik has set itself the goal of 25 % of the hotels in the core portfolio being certified with a Sustainability certificate according to the GSTC standard. _x000D_

_x000D_
Climate change is changing our world, making it one of the biggest threats of the 21st century. A first decisive step towards more climate-friendly travel is transparency: Emissions are calculated uniformly and presented for employees and customers, so that more climate-friendly travel could be offered and booked in the future. _x000D_
_x000D_
DER Touristik has therefore led the Centre for Sustainable Tourism together with Futouris (ZENAT) mandates to compile a market overview of the existing climate accounting systems. The overview showed that there are already good calculation bases for emissions from air traffic and methods that also determine the climate impact of other travel components. However, there is no climate accounting standard covering all elements of the tourism value chain and at the same time that would be accepted from as many partners as possible as an industry standard._x000D_

146,12,"Tourism and particularly tourism transport, contribute significantly to global environmental challenges, and effective policies to address these challenges remain largely absent. The research group Sustainable Tourism & Transport, therefore, strives for meaningful changes that contribute to a reduction of tourism’s environmental footprint by creating an impact on relevant tourism and environmental policy domains and on the awareness and practices of relevant organisations and the public at large. _x000D_
_x000D_
In our research, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap between the role of tourism and tourism transport in several global environmental challenges (notably climate change, but also biodiversity loss and health). We use our research to help businesses, consumers, and policymakers to take actions that effectively address these challenges.  _x000D_
_x000D_
Our research adopts an integrated perspective on tourism that include all tourist flows to and from destinations (domestic and international, and all travel purposes, including business travel). We do so by measuring environmental impacts and developing mitigating policies and strategies, including assessing the societal and economic implications. The results are not only sound reports and articles but also innovative research approaches and tools based on a solid translation of science to the sector practices. _x000D_
_x000D_
To this end, we: _x000D_
1.	Measure and forecast the effects of tourism and tourism transport on the environment – particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – and possible consequences for consumers and businesses under current and alternative policy regimes. _x000D_
2.	Examine and influence processes of policy formation to guide policy actors in the development of alternative policies that effectively address specific tourism-related environmental challenges – particularly climate change. _x000D_
3.	Explore innovative approaches, measures, ideas, and new applications._x000D_
4.	Develop innovative tools – including serious gaming applications and enlightening translations of scientific outcomes for both policy-makers, the public, and business leaders – to assist policy-making._x000D_
_x000D_
To create impact with our research, we aim for scientific integrity, quality, credibility, societal relevance, and consistency. Staying true to science is central to our approach. We only engage in consultancy and research projects when there is a direct link to our own research track record or knowledge of the scientific state-of-the-art. And we aim for solid, pro-active science communication and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders across the political spectrum. _x000D_
We do so by:_x000D_
1	Pursuing relevant research and consultancy projects in the tourism and environmental policy domain, with a focus on tourism-related transport issues. _x000D_
2	Integrate the findings in reports and outputs that are immediately relevant for stakeholders in this domain because they provide science-based directions to ongoing policy debates. _x000D_
3	Publishing the findings of our research in reputable, international peer-reviewed academic publications. _x000D_
4	Present and discuss our findings and hypotheses at international scientific and applied conferences and workshops. _x000D_
5	Engage with policymakers and the general public through mainstream media and other (social) media channels to address key societal challenges based on our research. _x000D_

Current situation: By participation in the European Union’s mission named 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030 (Mission for cities), the City of Zagreb plans to implement the activities under three priorities which encompass all phases of enhancement of single components contained in the measures. By increasing energy efficiency (“energy efficiency first”), by strongly stimulating the development and use of renewable energy sources, whose current share in energy balance of the City of Zagreb is almost insignificant, and by digitalisation of energy infrastructure (smart networks and remote reading of energy and water consumption), a systematic and synergistic transformation of the whole system will be ensured, as foreseen by the European Green Deal guidelines._x000D_
Stimulation of the introduction of zero-emission vehicles and the accompanying infrastructure will resolve one of the biggest problems in the area of the City of Zagreb, i.e. the continuously growing, negative, impact of emission gases from the traffic sector. Finally, considering the growing negative impact of climate changes, a series of activities concerning the adaptation to climate changes and local negative weather extremes has been defined in order to increase the resilience of the overall critical infrastructure and enhance the readiness of civil protection system. Urban planning, i.e. the processes of landscape planning in the City of Zagreb (PPGZ (Spatial Plan of the City of Zagreb), GUP (General Urban Development Plan), UPUs (Urban Landscaping Plans) etc.) are a very important legislative lever of the City, which has to be used by introducing energy and climate policies in those landscape planning documents in order to stimulate the green transition processes. _x000D_

195,10,"The information on tourism offers is now scattered across outdated paper media and many blogs and destination websites. Most travelers today use Google Maps or a similar application to find their way, but these lack interesting travel content.

SmartGuide pledges to digital travel content that combines geolocation and navigation with exciting local content in one product optimized to use on the go._x000D_
To grow the supply of such content offerings, SmartGuide pledges to offer its Content Management System (CMS) to content creators self-service for free to publish digital guides as long as they meet the content quality requirements.  The CMS makes content creation fast and easy with smart functions, such as the import of readily available open data (OSM, Wikipedia) automated route generation, built-in DeepL translations, and natural text-to-speech audio being recorded as you type. The CMS allows anyone to publish a professional travel guide as easy as uploading a video on YouTube. _x000D_
Unlike traditional guides (such as Lonely Planet), SmartGuide pledges to leverage the whole community to create guides that cater to tourists and locals with different interests. For example, more than 10 diverse public and private sector authors already contributed to the Prague guide, ranging from tourism boards, museums, campus, tour guides, event organizers and tour operator._x000D_

All of them achieved the Green Destinations Award, which required the development of a standard of 100 criteria and the preparation of an application with extensive evidence gathering. Lahemaa reached the gold level; Hiiumaa, Saaremaa, Järva County and Tartu silver and Pärnu and Rakvere bronze level. As a result of the audit, they have a report with recommendations for further development activities. So, the work in these destinations continues._x000D_

Based on previous work done in the Next Tourism Generation project (https://nexttourismgeneration.eu), Breda University of Applied Sciences provided a research methodology to assess current skills gaps and future skills needs. The Skills Assessment Methodology (SAM) is a tool that has been designed to identify current and future workforce skills at a national or regional level. As a key element of the Blueprint Strategy, the NTG Skills Assessment Methodology was developed as a research-based, structural mechanism for the analysis of rapidly changing skills and skills needs to develop strategies for addressing skills gaps in the EU Tourism Sector. The focus of the SAM are the skillsets necessary for the future of the workforce, specifically: digital, green and social skills._x000D_
_x000D_
The benefit of the SAM is that it can be used at multiple levels: regional, national or international, adding flexibility and improving feasibility. Although it was developed for assessing digital, green and social skills needs in five tourism subsectors, it can be easily expanded and used to address skills needs in other tourism ecosystems._x000D_
_x000D_
The SAM has been used in eight European countries to create a skills profile of the tourism sector and to formulate a response strategy. This resulted in the production of eight skills reports on current skills gaps and future skills needs. The SAM will be rolled out in at least five other European countries in the coming four years. _x000D_
_x000D_
Additionally, new Skills Assessment activities will be carried out throughout the PANTOUR project where Breda University of Applied Sciences leads the research approach on Skills Intelligence. The goal is to ensure a continuous and sustainable supply of Skills Intelligence that feed into sector-wide curricula, integrating work-based learning in the tourism ecosystem and addressing urgent skills needs._x000D_
